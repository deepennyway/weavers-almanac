Every tool has its purpose, every gear and axle a place in the mechanisms that make the world work. When you build a system, you know exactly how it works, and when something breaks, you know how to fix it.

This might leave you somewhat less prepared for dealing with other *people*, but with the right tool in your hand, you can accomplish anything.
