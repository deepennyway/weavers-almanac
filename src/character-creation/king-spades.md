You have your orders, and more importantly you know why you're following them. Maybe your instructions come from an employer, or a commander. Maybe they come from somewhere inside yourself. But you don't take the job if you don't know what you're doing, and why you're doing it. You've made that mistake before.

The other members of your group don't get it. Maybe some of them do, but you're the only one who knows what can go wrong if everybody isn't on the same page.
