Some people have no trouble existing in the world, living their lives, being themselves. It's not so easy for you. Whether because your insides are literally made of machinery or because your mind just works differently from what people expect, you have always felt that on some level you can't Be Yourself in the world; instead, you've learned to model what others expect of you, to be who they want you to be, to hide who or what you really are.

Makes it hard to figure out who you really are on the inside, or who you want to be. But at least this way you can survive.
