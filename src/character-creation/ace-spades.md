All you know is violence. Your only friends are the tools of violence. They’re the only friends you need.

People ask you how you sleep at night. You don’t. Why would you need to? Sleep is for those who have dreams. All your dreams are violence.

Your violence might not be physical. Your tools might not have blades or cannons. But your path is one of destruction, and if you stay on it too long, you’ll inevitably destroy yourself as well.
