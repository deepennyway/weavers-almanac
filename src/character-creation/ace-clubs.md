You'd rather work alone, but for some reason you keep getting sucked into protecting these other people who don't know what they're doing. You don't make friends, you don't hug, you *definitely* don't trust people. You've developed a set of rules for survival that you can name and number at a moment's notice, and if they sound overly specific to your current situation it's *because you've been in this exact situation before*.

You don't like these people. You don't know why you still stick with them. You swear, tomorrow you'll be gone. Really. This time you mean it.

Maybe the day after tomorrow. You certainly don't need them. It's them who'd be useless without you. Right?
