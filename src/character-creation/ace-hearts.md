Whether it’s a known fact of your existence that you cannot die or just that you have unaccountably good luck when it comes to avoiding deadly scrapes, you cannot die; this has given you a unique perspective on the ways of the world.

Pit full of acid? An inconvenience. Local baron sending soldiers into your town? A temporary frustration at most. You’ve seen how the world turns, and it always eventually turns again. It might have left you jaded, or cynical. But maybe it’s just that you know how things are, and that there’s no point fighting them. Just wait fifteen years; the weather will change on its own.

Even if it sometimes changes for the worse.

Maybe you really can’t die. Who did that to you? Did you do it to yourself? How long have you been walking this ball of dust? How many empires have you watched fall? When did you stop participating in history? When did you start avoiding its wake? How many lives have you lived, before you stopped caring about the world you’re stuck in?
