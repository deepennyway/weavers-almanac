    Noordin Ali is a freelance TTRPG designer, writer and consultant based currently in Canada. His credits include everything from Jiangshi: Blood in the Banquet Hall to Southlands 5e, and as such his approach can shift from time to time. Some things are consistent, however: bend, never break. Tell fascinating and enveloping stories. Be cognizant of potential harm.

    There's nothing better than telling a hard to tell story as safely as you can. Except a chocolate malt. Or werewolves.
