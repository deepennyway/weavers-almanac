If someone in the group has **injuries**, you may want to spend some time recovering from those injuries so that they don't make your lives more difficult. You can spend time in recovery at any time, wherever it makes sense within the context of the story you're telling.

The steps to complete this process are simple:
1. Remove one **injury** from any one skill that currently has at least one injury.

That's it. You don't have to roll dice, you don't have to spend a resource. You decide as a group that it's important to take some time to rest and recover, and you do it. That's all the mechanics of this game care about.

What *you* care about as players is entirely up to you. Do you have to go find a doctor to bind your wounds? Do you have to spend money on medicine? Are your injuries of a personal nature that require you to go find the person who wronged you and take revenge? That's all story, and it belongs to you, and you can give it as much or as little space as it demands for you and your group.

For this game? For these rules? Do it when it makes sense. Clear an injury when you do it. Try to avoid doing it in the middle of a scene. That's all you need to worry about **doing correctly**.
