You'd rather work alone, but for some reason you keep getting sucked into protecting these other people who don't know what they're doing. You don't make friends, you don't hug, you *definitely* don't trust people. You've developed a set of rules for survival that you can name and number at a moment's notice, and if they sound overly specific to your current situation it's *because you've been in this exact situation before*.

You don't like these people. You don't know why you still stick with them. You swear, tomorrow you'll be gone. Really. This time you mean it.

Maybe the day after tomorrow. You certainly don't need them. It's them who'd be useless without you. Right?

> ## Roleplaying Hook: *You Need Me (I Need You)*
>
> When someone helps you, choose one:
> - Assure them that you were doing just fine and that you didn't need the help actually.
> - Awkwardly acknowledge that they might have, maybe, *possibly* helped you out of a bind. Maybe.
> - Show a rare moment of real, raw vulnerability. Maybe it's a hug. Maybe it's just saying "thanks" for the first time ever.
