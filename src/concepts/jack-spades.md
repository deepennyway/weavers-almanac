You're a fighter. You fight. It's what you do best; why shouldn't you do it? It's not that you want to hurt people or break things; this is just how you express yourself. Or something. Look, we don't have to overcomplicate things, right? You're a fighter. You fight.

Some people fight with words, or with ideas. For you, it's all about the weapon in your hand. And you're *good* with that weapon. And people just...ugh, they just want you to *stop* and *think* and *wait for things* and *come oooon* that's *boring*.

Fighters fight, it's just how you are. If only everyone would just stop yelling at you.
