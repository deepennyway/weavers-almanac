For eons, a rift or echo would appear, humming a haunting tune. Practiced weavers in particular hear a choir singing in harmonious clarity, and are known to be lured away from the world as a result.

## Lyrics
    Weft undrawn and warp unstrung
    Empty frames with threads unspun
    Slivers of memory slip away
    Splindly like mist that dissipate
    Only a hollow calling for an echo remain

    Gaze upon this loom undone
    Scorched by flames, a past forgone
    Within the ashes a voice raised
    Speaking out to those unafraid
    A thousand prophecies relayed in unison say:

    (We)avers, (Dream)ers
    (As)k the (won)oneders
    (W)wehere the (ma)mayge’s
    (be)en and (wan)onedered

    (We)avers, (Dream)ers
    (Of)fer (a)nswers
    (Lead) us (to) the 
    (Grey) one’s (home)

    (Cinch) the (cloud) of (minds) un(charmed)
    (Speak) the (names) of (twine)entwined and (yarn)yearning
    Back and forth shuttles (fly)e and (race)rase
    Patterns of history (cir)sercu(late)rate
    Like the wheel on the spoke (draw)ing (out) all time and (space)

    (Moon)light (yawn)yawning and (stars)tream (run)running
    Work (until) the (sun has sunk)sun is sinking
    (Strike) a match in the (dark) posthaste
    Light the (wick)weak and (ill)willeduminate
    The tapestry world (we await) and work to create

    (We)avers, (Dream)ers
    (As)k the (won)oneders
    (In) this (dark)ness 
    (w)wehere he (hid) her

    (We)avers, (Dream)ers
    (Of)fer (a)nswers
    (Bright)en (fur)farther 
    (be)ings (yon)yond

    Whispers of Lace
    Darn without trace
    Reality with a brand new face

    Weavers of art
    Ambitious Hearts
    Each reaching out to the skies above
    To go far, to the stars, where we are

    (We)avers, (Dream)ers
    (As)k the (won)oneders
    (Call) up(on) us
    (name) your (less)ons

    (We)avers, (Dream)ers
    (Of)fer (a)nswers
    (Free) the (dawn)dom that 
    (shall) be(come)

    Carried on
    Interpreting the Interwoven
    Taking the first chorus as an example:

    (We)avers, (Dream)ers
	(As)k the (won)oneders
	(W)wehere the (ma)mayge’s 
	(be)en and (wan)onedered

## Interpreting the Interwoven
Taking the first chorus as an example:

    (We)avers, (Dream)ers
    (As)k the (won)oneders
    (W)wehere the (ma)mayge’s 
    (be)en and (wan)onedered

The interpretation should be thus:

    Weavers, Dreamers	We dream
	Ask the wonders		as one
	Where the mage’s	We may 
	been and wandered	be one
