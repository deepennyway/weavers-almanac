> An excerpt from Hues of the Harbor of Sound and Color: A Poetry Compilation, written by Hsien Lunyi.

    The ocean waves lap at the feet of the harbor,
    A steady pulse of a peace hard earned.

    Its surface glows,
    A crystalline blue, 
    A mirror to your soul,
    A window to when it was once 
                                                red.
    Where the only sounds were 
    Of clashing blades,
    Of screams by those who are no longer 
    with us,
    Of regrets that cannot be undone

    Where the only colors were
    Of soot and ash,
    Of crimson soaked rags,         
    Of a time that does not belong
                                                in the colorful hues of 
                                                        a new dawn.

                                                        The ocean glows,
                                                        Pink, purple and gold, 
                                                        Without a trace of red.
