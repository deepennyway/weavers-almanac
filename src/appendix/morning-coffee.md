I don’t always have the energy to get out the big press and wait five minutes. I don’t have the devices to use paper filters, and my coffee is too coarse for that anyway.

What do I have? A mesh kitchen strainer, a liquid measuring cup, and a mug. So let’s make some coffee.

## Making A Cup of Coffee When All You Have Is  A Mesh Strainer, A Liquid Measuring Cup, And A Mug

First, make sure your coffee is ground coarse, as coarse as it would need to be for a coffee press. (If you get your coffee from a store, ask them to grind it “As coarse as you can make it”)

Boil some water.

While waiting for the water to boil, put two tablespoons of coffee grounds in the bottom of the liquid measuring cup.

Add half of one tablespoon of your favorite sweetener. I use maple syrup.

When the water is boiling, pour it into the measuring cup. I do this slowly because I like mixing the grounds into the coffee with the pouring. If you don’t do that, use the tablespoon to stir it gently until everything is mixed.

Place the mesh strainer in the top of your mug.

Slowly pour the coffee from the measuring cup through the mesh strainer. Do your best to pour it into the same spot, so that you end up with a tidy little mound of coffee grounds in the strainer.

Add milk if you like.

Enjoy.
