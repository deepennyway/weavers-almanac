A small industry evolved in the city of Luminaria over the making and selling of recipes.

But no one would pay full price for a scrap of paper containing just a list of ingredients; so, the recipe artists began padding out their recipes with long stories about where the recipe came from, what was going through their head or their life when they developed it, or how they hope the recipe will bring joy to one’s home.

And the stories were interesting to read, if you had the time to read them; but most people don’t have the time to read _about_ a recipe when they’re trying to get dinner made and on the table before the kids start fussing.

What to do? If you knew that someone spent time telling you their story you would feel compelled to listen. A weaver was consulted, and the following ritual created. [#Lexi: Unless we want Weaver to be capitalized here? If we want it to be in general, I'll have to double back and add the caps in a lot of places.]

## Following A Recipe Where It Also Contains A Long Story And Your Kids Are Hungry And Impatient

First, find the recipe.

If it has no story attached, gather the ingredients and follow it.

But if it has a story attached:

Let your eyes wander across the words of the story, as quickly as is necessary, until you find the part where the story ends and the recipe begins.

Mark that place in pencil so you can find it more quickly the next time you make this recipe.

Set yourself a reminder to read the story while you wait for the water to boil, or for the onions to caramelize, or for the oven to warm up.

Whisper thanks to the person who wrote the story, for sharing a part of themselves with you while also helping you feed your family.

Now, follow the recipe and make dinner.
