Rhythm seizes senses first, a thrum that prickles skin  

And there ahead, within a camp a figure known as kin. 

With birdsong voice, they call and pull, they tempt you to draw near

So come in close and share a fire, for what is there to fear? 

What follows is their music soft, a gentle pleasing tune

It guides, it leads, it offers place, beneath the gleaming moon

So sit, so listen, so seek songs sweet and settle by the warmth and heat -

**But wait.**

A chord is struck, with finger’s flex and story starts to spill

Your racing heart, the snare of breath and suddenly there’s chill 

See now the shine of silver thread, and a jagged-tooth type smile

Dread swallowed, not honey sweet—you’re trapped by musician’s guile

**They begin to sing.**

_Take heed for where your feet do tread, for a dreamer’s silk may stray._

_It touches skin, and there you are, in a forest among the fey._

_And gentle though these strings may be, the tune it plays does strike a fee._

_A song of comfort and promised sleep, but when you wake your dreams they keep._

_But worry not, for all’s not lost. It’s there among the morning frost._

_Light pierces a green canopy, a forest made of pine._

_And there it is, a glimmer, coloured [#Lexi: Unexpected non-American spelling. Normalize to American English?] glass with fragments sharp that shine._

_They hold within a memory—something to recall._

_Though beware. Where there is light there’s also shadow, a nightmare and a fall._

_Weigh risk upon a set of scales for danger lurks in a selfish clutch_

_And darkness over all prevails, if hands are cut from a single touch._

_A fog will settle where once was clear, and in the darkness, shades appear._

_They’ll lurk in sleepers’ corner’s sight, shambling figures from the dead of night._

_For what is held is theirs to own, a trade for pleasant dreams they’ve shown._

_A theft will lead to trickery, bonds broken—you’ll hear the shatter._

_Try to escape, to run, and hide—for nought, it will not matter._

_Ahead of you, your frantic gaze, the forest grows into a maze,_

_and there you’ll be among **Unfound** in spirits’ realm now stuck and bound._

_So still your hands and walk instead_

_Show respect, and just ahead_

_Trees curl to form an arch and door, pass through—wake safe on the forest's floor._

_Untouched, unhurt, whole, and sound. Your head rests softly on the ground._

**_Are you tired?_ They ask. _Then rest._**

**_Let sleep settle in your bones._**

**_Listen,_ they say. _Take comfort._**

**_Follow rhythm, music, tones._**

**_But remember my warning—of the forest and the fey._**

**_There is a path, you must not stray._**

**_Goodnight, sleep tight._**

**_Good luck._**

**_May morning come with gentle light._**
