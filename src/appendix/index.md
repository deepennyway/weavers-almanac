A ritual is an action, or a pattern of actions, that carry meaning and purpose. A handshake can be a ritual. A recipe can be a ritual. A song can be a ritual.

The act of writing can be a ritual too. When you set your writing tools to work with meaning and purpose, you are engaging in a ritual action.

The rituals in this appendix might not all look like steps to follow. Sometimes the ritual is the reading of it. Take your time with these. Read them with care.
