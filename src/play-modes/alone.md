When your character is injured, you'll need to spend time recovering. Injuries might be physical ailments like a broken nose, or they might be periods of confusion, damaged tools, or broken relationships with people you care about. What an injury looks like is up to you and the others in your group; what is significant is how you recover, and learn, from the mistakes that led to that injury.

In *A Moment Alone*, your character separates themselves from the group to reflect, regroup, and repair the damage they have done to themselves. This short play mode is designed to take the place of an Individual Scene for your character.


If you need it, here's some framing: *You find yourself separated from the group. Maybe this is what you wanted. Maybe you just got lost in the Grey. Whatever the circumstances, here you are, alone. With ample time to consider your place in the world. Your wounds laid bare before you, waiting for you to address their needs.*

With that context, here's how it works.

## Recovery

To play out this mode, you must play a card that matches one of your injured suits. If you're playing *Deck Burner* and the card you draw from the deck doesn't match an injured suit, you don't find a moment to recover just yet; play out an individual scene as normal.

Take a moment to tell us how you recover the use of that skill: Do you take medicine? Are there amends you have to make with someone you wronged? Does someone emerge from the mists to help you, or to challenge you to do better?

You can go into as much or as little detail as makes sense for your character and for the injury from which they're recovering.

When you're done, roll a single die, using the below results to determine what happens:
- **1 (Bend):** You recover, but your extended absence leaves your friends on their own until you return. This suit is no longer injured; during the next Group Scene, you may not participate.
- **2â€“5 (Weave):** You are whole once more. This suit is no longer injured.
- **6 (Tear):** You are whole, but changed. This suit is no longer injured; increase the rating of one skill from that suit by 1, and change its name.
