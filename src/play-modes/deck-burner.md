title: Deck Burner
order: 3

Deck Burner is a mode of play designed to swiftly resolve a conflict. I'm personifying that conflict with the term **Adversary** here, but the conflict in each story will be different, and might not involve a specific person. My hope with this framework is that by the end of the game, your group will have either *overcome* the Adversary, or deepen their resolve against it.

For this variation, all you need is a shuffled deck of cards and enough dice for everyone to roll their skills.

To play, follow this pattern of phases:
- **Escalation:** Have each player play an Individual Scene, drawing a card from the top of the deck to frame each scene.
- **Confrontation:** Play out a single Group Scene, using the accumulated Complications and your knowledge of the Adversary as fuel. Have each player draw a card from the top of the deck to frame their actions in the scene.

At the end of the Confrontation, if the players have the high roll, decide:
- The Adversary has been defeated! End the game here.
- The Adversary has retreated to a more strategic position! Repeat the pattern again, beginning with **Escalation**.

After each Resolution, take a short break to let everyone breathe, stretch, grab a snack, drink some water, and take care of any other needs. When the group comes back together, take a moment to get everyone settled, and then decide whether to repeat the pattern or end the game here.

> Need to pick it up later? That's okay! You don't need to keep track of what cards were played for this; just shuffle the deck anew next time, and pick up the story where you left off.

> For pacing, I recommend always starting with Escalation; that way you don't have to keep track of Complications between sessions, and you can track them during the session however works best for you and your group.
