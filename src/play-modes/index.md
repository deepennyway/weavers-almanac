Once you've all made characters and are ready to begin telling their story, it's time to choose a mode of play. In *Mnemonic* there are four [#Lexi: Which 4 of these? Or is that number outdated?] such modes:

- **First Gathering:** A short introduction to everyone's characters, letting the players bring their characters into the story. [#Lexi:  Might be good to make this, and the others, direct links?]
- **Into the Grey:** An extended exploration of the story's key elements, from people and places to important objects and events. This mode is intended to last multiplay play sessions.
- **Deck Burner:** A fast-paced resolution to the story's main conflict or to one of its many smaller conflicts.
- **A Moment Alone:** A brief ritual for clearing injuries from skills and reflecting on a character's choices.
- **Laid to Rest:** A somber ritual for saying good-bye to a character or to the story as a whole.
- **Game Face:** A short game for settling scores between players' characters.

In order to play *Mnemonic*, everyone will need to have a character journal prepared, as well as some numbered six-sided dice ready to roll (two per person should be plenty, at least for the first time you play). Your group will also need a standard 54-card poker deck, which need to be shuffled and/or divided as needed by the mode you choose.

If you're not sure what story you want to tell, the *First Gathering* can help you discover that through play; alternatively, you can choose one of the many Story Arcs provided within the **Mnemonic Setting**.
