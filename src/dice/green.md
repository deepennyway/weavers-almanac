description: The Green Die is a warm cube of compressed glass. At a glance, it may appear a plunging black, but time and observation exhumes a spectrum of verdant green. Nested in its faces are indecipherable counts of pips, changing the more certain you think you are of their numbers. 
effect:
    bend: You recall a time when the world filled you with wonder and excitement. An uncanny emissary provides you with a vital piece of information. 
    weave: You remember a time when a beast instilled deep fear in you. A similar beast is summoned, and will accept one command from you. When this command is completed, they mark you before departing.  
    fray: You remember a moment when the line between you and the world around you was indiscernible. A stampede of plants, animals, and insects arrives. They can be herded, but will continue to trample until the weaving ends. Whatever remains of the swarm will scatter back into the world, leaving in its wake whatever you had brought.
    tear: You tap into a long memory of molten earth and churning seas. It may or may not be your own. The environment distorts itself suddenly and violently, with little regard for its own dominion. The lands will remember what you have done to them.

The Green Die is a die of renewal, harboring both the cold of deep dirts and the warmth of new life. It is an emissary of life on all scales, and demands the cycle of the world continueâ€”offering the desperate a secure place in that cycle, so long as they carry that burden... 

When you hold the Green Die in your hands, you feel the pulse of life around you and the pulls of their struggles (including your own). As it bounces in your hands, you observe the breaths of a thousand lifeforms as if they were resting on your shoulders. When the die is thrown, the breathing grows more and more intense, suddenly stopping when the die comes to a rest.

> When you weave with the Green Die, consider the following:
>
> - Have you woven with the Green Die recently? Are all your duties fulfilled?
> - When will you give up the Green Die? Will you ever?
