arttext: "A clockwork fox stares in wonder at a bright blue clockwork kingfisher." Just going to use this spot to note - that's the alt text(?) of the Metal Die artwork, not the Cloth Die, and I'm a little unclear across all the stuff how the arttext stuff comes through so I'll be mostly editing it as though it's text that will appear directly *and* be read by anything that shows alt text, but if it's basically empty then (other than the first one I marked) I'll leave it as-is, assuming someone has yet to write it.

description: "The Cloth Die's surfaces are a patchwork of materials, bits and pieces that were left over from other dice that the maker didn't want to go to waste. There's a bit of everything here. The numbers appear to be stitched into the surface with multicolored thread."
