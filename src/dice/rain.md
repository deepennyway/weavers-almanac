arttext: A rain cloud pours down thick sheets of rain. The mechanical bronze arms of a mechanical humanoid figure reach out from the water, either enthralled or baffled by the deluge.
description: The Rain Die is a deep aquamarine with moss-covered numbers that ripple when they are touched. Clouds of various shapes dance around its heart. 
effect:
    bend: A fine mist beings to fall. It is cool and refreshing as it touches your skin. 
    weave: Rain arrives to do your bidding. Perhaps it comes with clouds. Perhaps a sunshower. The rain nourishes what you wish to nourish or extinguishes what you need to extinguish.
    fray:  The rain arrives as you wish, but there is far more than expected. More than any plant or person could take in or absorb. The land around you becomes difficult to navigate. 
    tear: There is a brief silence before the heavens above and the ground below erupt. Geysers burst forth, rivers overflow, and heavy rains wash away everything in sight. Those caught in its flow are swept away along with the debris. Only a few pebbles, twigs, and hints of what used to be are left behind.

A herald of the spring, rain visits us all, letting nearby nature know renewal is just around the bend. Quiet taps on the roof of a home. The sound of droplets on leaves. The smell of wet earth and nearby flowers. The promise of new life to follow. Too much, though, and what once nourished life overflows to destroy it. Rivers break their bounds and people can find themselves in grave danger at a moment's notice.

Roll the Rain Die when you need refreshment and nourishment. When you do, know that the first drop is the herald of thousands more.

> When you weave with the Rain Die, consider the following:
>
> - What does the rain draw out or obscure in the world around you? 
> - What does the rain leave behind? What seeds take root?
> - In what way is this rain cleansing?
