The opening text for your new die should contain three body-length paragraphs, each paragraph addressing one of the following:

- What does it mean for the player to hold this die in their hand? (2-3 sentences)
- Place this die in context with the rest of the world. What does its power represent within the world of Mnemonic? (2-3 sentences)
- What happens when the player rolls this die? What power does it hold?

> When someone weaves with this die:
> 
> - Ask the player to frame the die in context of their own character's memories.
> - Ask the player why their character rolls *this* die in particular. The character might not know themselves.
