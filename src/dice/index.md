The Weaver's Dice are a special set of dice that a weaver keeps safe, separate from their other play materials. Some weavers keep these dice in individually housed containers, ready to produce at a moment's notice. Others keep them together in a bag. There's no one right way to store your Weaver's Dice.

The entries in this chapter describe thirteen of the most common dice in the world of Mnemonic. If none of them fit your specific needs, you can develop your own using the template provided.

> Each dice entry comes with a description of the physical die, but don't feel obligated to seek out and purchase a die that matches the specific description. You should try to roll dice that feel comfortable to you, or that fit the feeling of what you're rolling them for. If a die doesn't feel right, find one that does.

## Using a Weaving Die
In any Individual Scene, after resolving your action, you can ask another player (or the Facilitator, if one is present) to choose a Weaving Die for you. They can choose any of the weaving dice described in this chapter, or they can invent a new one on the spot based on the needs of your character and the world around them.

The rules for weaving are included in the Basics of Play, but the short version is this:
- A 1 is bad.
- A 6 is also bad.
- A 2 or 3 is good.
- A 4 or 5 is good but should probably make you feel bad.
