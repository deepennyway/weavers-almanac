description: The Wind Die is a translucent blue, its edges sharp as blades, its faces smooth and cool. Its heart is a constant spinning tempest, whistling its strong winds to your ears as if it were a storm that was just out of your range of sight. Sometimes, if you look really closely, you can see something spinning within that storm. 
effect:
    bend: You tap into a personal memory of wind, but it is fleeting and volatile. You witness the briefest vision of something taking place currently elsewhere.
    weave: You tap into a personal memory of wind, and it shares something important or offers you a potent effect in concert with the elements around it. Any vision or guidance you seek through this will resemble the ways in which those elements mingle within each other, clash against each other, or are brought to bear in unison against other forces.
    fray: The wind that you tap into is a gale, roaring through your body and everything around you, threatening to lift you off the ground. Any vision or guidance you seek through this is clouded by clashing metaphor, overwhelming your senses.
    tear: The wind that you tap into is a cyclone, threatening to destroy everything around it with impunity. While within the eye of that storm, the weaver is overcome with visions of things they did not expect, some giving wisdom, others offering only woe or terror.

The Wind Die, like the element that grants it that title, is volatile on its own, but always defined by what it can bring with it to any situation. It can take a ship to shore, but only if there are sails to catch it; it can stir up a blazing inferno, but only if the spark was there for it to spread. In much the same way, the Wind Die accentuates the memories of dice that are rolled alongside them, giving way to deeper magic and wider prophetic revelation when read accurately. 




> When you weave with The Wind, consider the following:
> * What sounds or scents come to mind when the wind blows past you? What memories are those sensations bonded to? 
> * What was the last thing that the wind has brought to you, or taken from you?
