This book was made possible by the successful raising of funds through Kickstarter. Those funds paid for writing, illustrations, editing, and layout, not to mention consultation for accessibility and web development. The people that worked on this project are credited below.

To everyone who gave money to the project that allowed this book to exist in its current state, thank you. We don't always get to make the things we want, but direct funding eliminates a lot of barriers for us.
