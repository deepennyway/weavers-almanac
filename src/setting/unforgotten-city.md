Among the wonders of the world are its cities, each has its own stories and legends, and people that create new ones all the time. While some cities are remembered for their events, others cities are sentient and remember things themselves while enjoying the new memories that their citizens make. 

However, as sentient beings often do, some cities feel discontent or sorrow with what they remember. Others feel anxious about things like war, or not providing enough for their residents, or that they might be forgotten. Occasionally, some cities move to prevent these things and to protect their people and themselves.

## Story Arc: Of Fear and Forgetting
In this story, we visit a city known by many names to many people, but known to everyone as the Unforgotten City, where we imagine ourselves as people who are new to the city. We walk the streets seeing what marvels and memories the city holds and learn a concerning truth.

### First Gathering
You gather at a well-lit town square where people are dressed in various costumes. Streamers and lights decorate the streets and buildings as far as the eye can see, and you can feel joy from every brick and cobblestone. You senses are filled with laughter and the smell of delicious foods. It is during this spectacle that you meet your first new friend, Martin of the Whimsical Whizzbang.

### Into the Grey
The next day, people are removing decorations from the previous night’s festivities. You run into Martin who seems a bit out of sorts. He expresses that he is having some difficulty returning to his home. The city is many things, but large is not one of them.

### Deck Burner
As you talk to Martin and try to help him find his way home, you find yourself unable to leave the city. Paths you take twists and turn unexpectedly, all leading back into the city. You decide to ask the city for help, but it refuses to assist. What is the city not telling you?

### Laid to Rest
It is a day’s journey outside of the city and Martin has long since gone home. Most of the residents continued on as normal, but you find yourself thinking about the city and how it will treat others who wish to leave it. You hope it will remember what you’ve shared.
