When the sun shines upon rooftops adorned with colorful fabrics and nets , hanging from one home to the other, the residents of this quiet sea village stirs to life, welcoming dawn with open arms. 

The sound of ocean waves shifting underneath wooden floors is a wakeup call to many, as are the residents accustomed to living in a village built on ocean waters. They begin to move to and fro their destinations with small oar boats decorated in trinkets equally vibrant and full of personality, going about their day full of purpose.

When moonlight graces the calm still waters of night, the harbor glows in beautiful hues and the people celebrate with hearty songs and energetic melodies, grateful for today’s peace, and the peace of the many todays that came before-- for their history is marred with a violence that they have long since moved on. 

> **The journey to reach it will not be easy-- standing in your way far too many shipwrecks and submerged ruins, but yet, if you still choose to travel to this sleepy, secluded village, consider the following:**
> - What sparse rumors have you heard about this quiet village that compelled you to set forth on your travels?
> - When you arrive, what are the things you see around the harbor that have been left behind by their days long gone?
> - Who are the only few that are willing to speak privately about the harbor’s history?
> - What sorts of festivals do they invite you to participate in, and what tales and meaning do they bring with them?

## Story Arc: Spear in the Sand
Remnants of the Old War, though present, have been given new life, new colors, new purpose-- save for the lone, weathered spear that stands steadfast along the shoreline near the harbor’s otherwise colorful and lively entrance. 

### First Gathering
You’ve heard rumors about this spear. The grief and tragedy it has caused travel far and wide, as if it has left a permanent scar on this world. The residents don’t seem to acknowledge it, hustling along their busy day-- save for a select few. They have the look of someone who has seen far too much.

### Into the Grey
The people of the village invite you to join in the nightly festivities. Tonight is one of how the Harbor gained its name, and you help with the preparations needed, learning more about its traditions and beliefs, yet never about the spear.

### Deck Burner
Night falls, and the celebrations begin. Spirits are high, but you feel something is amiss-- the spear is missing. No one seems to acknowledge it. Find it, and perhaps then will you learn about the harbor’s history.

### Laid to Rest
Eventually, you find the perpetrator, a solemn look on their face. They tell you they cannot forget-- not like the others. What means did you have to take to make them divulge? What truths did they reveal to you that you were not ready for? Moving forward, you now saddle a new burden from this knowledge.
