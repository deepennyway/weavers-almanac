Mnemonic is an anti-canon setting, which means that everything we present is meant to be revised and personalized to fit the needs of the story you're telling. If you have strong associations with the color green, for instance, you might make it a feature of your story that when someone weaves a memory, the world around them takes on a green tinge.

You can embrace the anti-canon nature of the setting as a facet of your worldbuilding, or use it as license to change things as you need to. That being said, there are some things that are important to us as writers that, if you do change certain things, you at least know their importance.

The entries in this chapter describe places, people, events, or objects of interest that you might want to include in your worldbuilding. You don't need to use all of them, and you don't need to use them as presented. Some entries come with questions to guide your storytelling. Some include sample story arcs to provide you with a ready-made structure for playing games with the session frameworks in this book. *(Some entries might even contradict other entries. The setting is anti-canon even within itself.)*

For storytellers who want to flesh out the world in similar ways, we've also provided a template that you can use to write your own anti-canon setting entries.

Take what you need. Change what doesn't fit. Discard the rest. Enjoy your journey through the world of memory.
