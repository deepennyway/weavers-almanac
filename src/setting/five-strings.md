Every culture shares stories that inspire courage, share knowledge, and teach wisdom. Among those stories is one about a drought, the five weavers that brought rain to end it, and the wisdom they left for those who would come after them. 

Some say these stories are our only memories of the first weavers. While the number of weavers varies from one story to another, it is most commonly known as the Tale of Five Strings, told every year during the harvesting season around friends and family at a warm campfire. 

> **_If you tell a story that includes the Five Strings, consider the following:_**
> *   _Where did you first hear the story of the Five Strings?_
> *   _In the story you learned, where did the drought take place?_
> *   _How do you prepare to tell this story?_
> *   _What does this story teach you about the **purpose** of power?_

## Story Arc: A Turn of the Loom

In this story, we imagine ourselves as the weavers at the center of it . We walk the world in their shoes, finding others who are on the cusp of emerging as weavers like themselves.

### First Gathering

You meet in a town that has been enduring an inexplicable drought for several years. This year promises a harsh winter and reserves are running low. It is in this situation that you may find your way to your first world memory.

### Into the Grey

Within the town, you hear grumbles from the townspeople growing agitated at the thought of another lean winter. Neighboring towns have shared their supplies where they could, but they cannot do this indefinitely. If a solution can’t be found, this year might be the last for many people here.

### Deck Burner

In the middle of the night, the smell of smoke wakes you from your sleep. Outside, a man in opulent clothing stands in the middle of the road. They compliment your work in saving the town, but inform you that this doesn’t work for them. Beyond them, strangers dressed in mercenary garb set fire to shops and homes. The man’s smirk dares you to stop him. [#Lexi: Specifying them as being a *man* before and after using they/them every single time my hairs stand on end but gender (esp nonbinary) is a pain in the ass, so I don't want to change that until and unless we have an unambiguous statement from Syn that this is *not* intended to be a person whose gender identity & expression is "Man (they/them)" specifically and with intent]

### Laid to Rest

It is three days later and while many things have been rebuilt, your confrontation has left much of the town changed. As the sun sets on this place, your thoughts wander back to the drought, the man who burned the town, and the future.
