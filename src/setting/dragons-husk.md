Not every dragon was wiped out of existence in the same moment; there were plenty of the foul creatures who were slain in combat, their corpses falling to land heavily in forests, marshes, oceans. Over the many years since their deaths, the largest of the husks remain features in the landscape, their hollow corpses having developed thriving natural ecosystems for plants, animals, and other forms of life.

Yet the world has a hard time letting these monsters go, and echoes wander about the place—many of warriors who were eaten or torn apart by the dragon's fury. Some of them are friendly. Others know only anger at an existence that will never end.

## Story Arc: The Dungeon in the Dragon
In this story, we explore the ruined corpse of one of these massive creatures. Our journey takes us into the heart of its remains, where we face an echo of the dragon's memory and try to put it to rest.

> Dragons were initially imagined as allegories of empire. If you, like me, are descended from those who pursued empire, or are currently a beneficiary of empire yourself, I encourage you to be careful of how your stories rationalize or glorify the actions of conquering forces.

### First Gathering
We meet our circle of weavers in a village nearby. It’s a place where travelers stop to rest before making the arduous detours necessary to avoid stepping too close to the Husk. In our sleep, we are all tormented by whispers of temptation: riches, power, secrets.

### Scene Play
Something draws us near the Husk: a promise of answers to questions, or a request to retrieve an heirloom that was lost long ago. 

### Deck Burner
At the heart of the dragon’s corpse, an echo lingers of the dragon themself, desperately searching, hunting for a way to restore their body to life. Their will presses into the surrounding landscape, creating dangerous echoes and other hazards that stand in the way of any who might seek to quiet the dragon’s endless whispers.

### Laid to Rest
With the dragon defeated—or not—we return to the town with news of our success or failure. At night, we spend time in reflection, mourning our losses, and looking to the future.
