            <article>
                
                
                
                <h1>Skills</h1>
                <p>Your character’s success is driven by their skills. Each skill is tied to one of four suits, each one representing a broad category of actions. In order to use a skill, you must match it to the suit of a card you play, either from your hand or from the top of the deck. This ensures that you won’t always use the same skill.</p>
<p>There’s no rule requiring you to follow any particular classification of skills for each suit; you can tie the suits to any four categories you like, as long as you have some understanding of what each suit represents for you.</p>
<p>That being said, here are the suits as I’ve imagined them:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Spades:</strong> Tools of the trade, weapons of war, these are the things that you craft or own or have personal relationship to that are outside of yourself, which are so much a part of you that they are an <em>extension</em> of yourself.</li>
<li><strong>Clubs:</strong> Relationships with people and the world around you. You might have skills that address specific kinds of social interaction like Ordering Takeout, or you might have had to develop skills for dealing with specific people, like Officer Spangleburst.</li>
<li><strong>Diamonds:</strong> Talents of the mind, or wisdom gleaned from study or experience. You might be very good at Puzzles, or maybe you just Know About Reptiles.</li>
<li><strong>Hearts:</strong> Your body is your home, your vessel, your shelter. Take care of it, and it will take care of you. Maybe you can Climb really well. Maybe your Yearning is so strong it’s physical.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-makes-a-good-skill%3F" tabindex="-1">What Makes a Good Skill?</h2>
<p>A skill is anything you want your character to be able to do. All skills follow the same rules, so the name you give a skill should serve to remind you of your character’s motivations, where they come from, or where they learned the skill. So you might have a skill called Fight, or Brawl, or Fisticuffs, or Melee, or Martial Arts—what differs between these skills is what they mean to and say about your character.</p>
<p>There’s no core list of skills; if you want your character to be able to do something, put it on your list of skills under the suit that feels right to you. If you need ideas, the provided Sample Character Concepts all include suggested skills that you can borrow for your own concept.</p>
<p>I recommend sharing your skills with your group, to give other players a chance to clarify the implications of, say, a <strong>Piloting Spaceships</strong> skill on the group’s shared setting. But as long as everyone in the group is on board, go for it.</p>
<h2 id="can-i-choose-weaving-as-a-skill%3F" tabindex="-1">Can I Choose Weaving as a Skill?</h2>
<p>If you want your character to be able to call on magic in a more controlled manner than what is described in the Weaving rules, you can add whatever magic you like as a skill. The <strong>Weaver’s Dice</strong> chapter includes thirteen types of weaving that could also be good candidates for skills.</p>
<p>Note that having a weaving listed as a skill doesn’t give you special advantages when using the Weaving mechanics; if you perform a weaving during an Individual Scene, you still roll a single die and you still risk injury. Using a skill tied to one of the weaving dice is not the same as accepting a weaving die; when you use it as a skill, you’re using your skill at weaving to achieve a specific desired outcome.</p>
<h2 id="improving-your-skills" tabindex="-1">Improving Your Skills</h2>
<p>A skill’s rating improves by 1 immediately in any of the following circumstances:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Moment of Inspiration:</strong> When using a given skill during an Individual or Group Scene, your <em>lowest</em> rolled result is a 6.</li>
<li><strong>The Weaver’s Lesson:</strong> When using a given skill during an Individual or Group Scene, your <em>highest</em> rolled result is a 1.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each skill can only benefit from one of these avenues of learning per session, and all three of the above methods of improvement must be used before a single method can be used again.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if your group is following a story arc, you can say that each skill can only benefit from each method once per story arc.</p>
<h2 id="learning-new-skills" tabindex="-1">Learning New Skills</h2>
<p>If you want your character to be able to do something but you’ve never done it before and it’s not currently a skill, you can roll it with a rating of 0. When you use a skill with a rating of 0, you roll zero dice, which means that a result of 6 is impossible; in an Individual Scene, this always results in a Complication.</p>
<p>After resolving the Complication in a Group Scene, record that skill in your journal with a rating of 1.</p>
<blockquote>
<h2 id="optional-rule%3A-universal-truth" tabindex="-1">Optional Rule: Universal Truth</h2>
<p>As an option, your group can decide that once a skill reaches a rating of 6, the character’s skill becomes a kind of universal truth for the world of the story. Mark the action with a star or something to let you know it’s special. Color it with a highlighter. It’s special now.</p>
<p>A skill that has been marked as a universal truth cannot be further improved.</p>
<p>When someone performs a weaving, they can instead ask you to use your universal truth. Roll a single die:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>1 (Bend):</strong> They call for your aid, but you are otherwise occupied, unable to lend your assistance. They <strong>mark an injury</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>2-5 (Weave):</strong> They call for your aid and you bring it, solving the challenge in front of you with ease.</li>
<li><strong>6 (Tear):</strong> They call for your aid and you bring it, but your overconfidence causes other problems that they must then deal with. They <strong>mark an injury</strong>.</li>
</ul>
