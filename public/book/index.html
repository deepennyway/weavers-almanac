            <p>This book was made possible by the successful raising of funds through Kickstarter. Those funds paid for writing, illustrations, editing, and layout, not to mention consultation for accessibility and web development. The people that worked on this project are credited below.</p>
<p>To everyone who gave money to the project that allowed this book to exist in its current state, thank you. We don’t always get to make the things we want, but direct funding eliminates a lot of barriers for us.</p>

        
            <h1>A Note About Safety</h1>
            <p>Mnemonic is a game and setting designed with the intent of being careful in the stories we tell. My <em>hope</em> is that it is safe to play, with the assumption that your group is safe to play with.</p>
<p>That said, no game is perfect. What follows are some notes about how I think about safety.</p>
<p>Safety means that everyone at the table is empowered to collaborate. If the story ignores a player’s boundaries, the story becomes unsafe for that player.</p>
<p>Safety means that when you take risks, everyone at the table knows what those risks are and has consented to them. If things cross a boundary for you, safety at the table means you’re comfortable saying so.</p>
<p>Safety means taking breaks to give people a chance to breathe and stretch and grab a snack if they need to, and checking in with each other frequently to make sure everyone is on board with where the story is going.</p>
<p>The rules provide some time during the process of making your character for thinking about and defining some boundaries. Beyond that, I won’t tell you how to create safety at your table; every player’s needs are different, and what works for some groups won’t work for others. What I will say is that you should <em>consider</em> how to make your play group a safe environment for everyone, so that no one is left feeling like their needs won’t be respected.</p>
<p><strong>Take care of yourself. Take care of each other.</strong></p>
<h2 id="avoiding-bleed" tabindex="-1">Avoiding Bleed</h2>
<p>In Mnemonic, you don’t play a hero; instead, you play the part of a <em>storyteller, sitting around a table, telling the story of your chosen hero.</em> The things that happen in the story are not happening to you; they are happening to someone you’ve imagined into being. You might have strong feelings about your character, but they are not you, and you are not them.</p>
<p>For some people (myself included) that layer of separation is important for mitigating <strong>bleed</strong>, which is when a player begins to experience the emotions of their character. Sometimes bleed is an enjoyable experience, especially if you have the training and tools to safely decompress afterward.</p>
<p>Not everyone has that training, and the tools that work for some won’t work for everybody. As a matter of safety, I think it’s important to give players explicit permission to step out of the story when they need to—and if a player needs to enforce a boundary, it’s important that the other players be able to respect that boundary without being forced suddenly out of their character’s harder emotions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> While playing, my character, Loch, enters into a challenging conversation with her mother about changing her name. This is a scene I know plays close to my own heart, so I make a decision in the moment: Am I going to play this scene out verbally, or just say that it happens for the sake of the story and move on? The emotions might be important to the story I want to tell with this character, but today might not be a good day for that. So I choose:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Play it Out:</strong> Loch stands her ground; enough is enough. “Mom, I’ve told you a hundred times - my name is <em>Loch</em>, not <em>Mouse</em>. I don’t know how else to get you to understand!”</li>
<li><strong>Describe it:</strong> Loch stands her ground, and it turns into a big argument over whether she’s allowed to change her name, what it means to leave her old name behind, what that means for her family…it’s messy, and it goes on way too long.</li>
<li><strong>Skip it:</strong> Loch stands her ground and demands that her mother use her new name. We don’t need to go into detail.</li>
</ul>
<p>If I decide to play it out, I’m also going to ask somebody else to join me in the scene as Loch’s mother, which means I need to also check with the group if they’re up for the emotions involved here. And I need to be ready for people to say no.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Does this mean you can’t roleplay scenes in-character? Maybe. I think I would more encourage you to remain aware of yourself as a separate entity from your character, even if you do briefly speak on their behalf.</p>
<p>Just…just <em>be careful</em>, okay?</p>

        
            <h1>Preparing Your Journal</h1>
            <p>Before you begin developing your character, you’ll need a workspace for keeping track of everything. You are not required to maintain the record of your character in any specific way, but for the purposes of this chapter I’ll assume you’re keeping your character’s details in a journal: any bound collection of paper that you feel comfortable writing in and flipping through.</p>
<p>(Much of this can also work well for a digital notebook if paper isn’t a viable option.)</p>
<h2 id="choosing-a-journal" tabindex="-1">Choosing A Journal</h2>
<p>I have a hard time coming back to a journal if I don’t like the way it feels to hold and write in it. I have a wide collection of empty journals or journals with a few pages of writing in the front and then nothing else. I have expensive journals I never use because they make me feel like I have to Write Quality Writing, and that’s not helpful when I just want to write.</p>
<p>So if you’re like me, don’t use a journal you won’t want to return to. Find something comfortable <em>for you</em>.</p>
<h2 id="setting-things-just-so" tabindex="-1">Setting Things Just So</h2>
<p>Now that you have a journal you like, it’s time to set up your workspace.</p>
<h3 id="the-first-page" tabindex="-1">The First Page</h3>
<p>The first page of your character’s journal should contain all the basic details of your character, so that when you open it up you know at a glance whose story you’re returning to.</p>
<p>You’ll fill in the details as you go, but for now it might be a good idea to set up some blank spaces with the following labels:</p>
<ul>
<li>Name</li>
<li>Pronouns</li>
<li>Strong Suit</li>
<li>Current Stress</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also, optionally, leave space to describe your character’s home community, their species (if that’s important to you or them), and any other details you want to be at the very front of your journal.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Write in pencil.</strong> Some of the things on this page might change as the story progresses!</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="the-group" tabindex="-1">The Group</h3>
<p>You won’t know anything about the other characters in your group until you sit down and play with them, but I recommend making space in your journal to fill in some basic details about them. At the very least, you’ll want to include the name and pronouns of everyone you travel with, so that when you engage with them in the story, you know how to refer to them.</p>
<h3 id="injuries" tabindex="-1">Injuries</h3>
<p>On the next right-hand page, write the word “Injuries” at the top, and set up the following column headings:</p>
<ul>
<li>Injury</li>
<li>Severity</li>
<li>Description</li>
</ul>
<p>Don’t worry about filling in this table; you’ll use this page when your character suffers injuries during play.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Again, write in pencil.</strong> You’ll need to be able to change and erase entries from this table as you play!</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="the-suit-pages" tabindex="-1">The Suit Pages</h3>
<p>Your character’s skills and abilities will be organized into four groups, tied to the four suits of a poker deck. You <em>can</em> put them all on one page, but in order to give you room to grow, I recommend giving each suit its own full piece of paper, so:</p>
<ul>
<li>At the top of the next right-hand page, write the name of one of the four suits</li>
<li>Leave the back of that page blank page</li>
</ul>
<p>This way, you can easily flip through your journal to find your lists of skills.</p>
<p>For now you don’t need to do anything else with these pages, but for your reference here’s what the suits generally represent:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th style="text-align:left">Suit</th>
<th style="text-align:left">Category</th>
<th style="text-align:left">Example Skills</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">Hearts</td>
<td style="text-align:left">Skills representing the character’s ability to move their own body</td>
<td style="text-align:left">climbing, swimming, running, fighting</td>

<td style="text-align:left">Spades</td>
<td style="text-align:left">Skills representing the effectiveness of the character’s tools or objects</td>
<td style="text-align:left">swords, lockpicks, medicine, armor</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">Clubs</td>
<td style="text-align:left">Skills representing things that are outside of the character’s control or that require the intervention of other people</td>
<td style="text-align:left">persuasion, luck, allies</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h3 id="empty-pages" tabindex="-1">Empty Pages</h3>
<p>The rest of the journal is reserved for describing your character’s journey. Keep track of people they meet, places they go, objects they acquire, favors they owe. I recommend not filling anything else out until you need it.</p>
<h2 id="that%E2%80%99s-it!" tabindex="-1">That’s it!</h2>
<p>That’s all you need to do to get your journal ready for play. But you can add details if you’re feeling inspired: decorations on each of the suit pages, a space for adding maps, anything you like. Make this your favorite place to think about your character and the story they’re in.</p>

        
            <h1>Skills</h1>
            <p>Your character’s success is driven by their skills. Each skill is tied to one of four suits, each one representing a broad category of actions. In order to use a skill, you must match it to the suit of a card you play, either from your hand or from the top of the deck. This ensures that you won’t always use the same skill.</p>
<p>There’s no rule requiring you to follow any particular classification of skills for each suit; you can tie the suits to any four categories you like, as long as you have some understanding of what each suit represents for you.</p>
<p>That being said, here are the suits as I’ve imagined them:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Spades:</strong> Tools of the trade, weapons of war, these are the things that you craft or own or have personal relationship to that are outside of yourself, which are so much a part of you that they are an <em>extension</em> of yourself.</li>
<li><strong>Clubs:</strong> Relationships with people and the world around you. You might have skills that address specific kinds of social interaction like Ordering Takeout, or you might have had to develop skills for dealing with specific people, like Officer Spangleburst.</li>
<li><strong>Diamonds:</strong> Talents of the mind, or wisdom gleaned from study or experience. You might be very good at Puzzles, or maybe you just Know About Reptiles.</li>
<li><strong>Hearts:</strong> Your body is your home, your vessel, your shelter. Take care of it, and it will take care of you. Maybe you can Climb really well. Maybe your Yearning is so strong it’s physical.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-makes-a-good-skill%3F" tabindex="-1">What Makes a Good Skill?</h2>
<p>A skill is anything you want your character to be able to do. All skills follow the same rules, so the name you give a skill should serve to remind you of your character’s motivations, where they come from, or where they learned the skill. So you might have a skill called Fight, or Brawl, or Fisticuffs, or Melee, or Martial Arts—what differs between these skills is what they mean to and say about your character.</p>
<p>There’s no core list of skills; if you want your character to be able to do something, put it on your list of skills under the suit that feels right to you. If you need ideas, the provided Sample Character Concepts all include suggested skills that you can borrow for your own concept.</p>
<p>I recommend sharing your skills with your group, to give other players a chance to clarify the implications of, say, a <strong>Piloting Spaceships</strong> skill on the group’s shared setting. But as long as everyone in the group is on board, go for it.</p>
<h2 id="can-i-choose-weaving-as-a-skill%3F" tabindex="-1">Can I Choose Weaving as a Skill?</h2>
<p>If you want your character to be able to call on magic in a more controlled manner than what is described in the Weaving rules, you can add whatever magic you like as a skill. The <strong>Weaver’s Dice</strong> chapter includes thirteen types of weaving that could also be good candidates for skills.</p>
<p>Note that having a weaving listed as a skill doesn’t give you special advantages when using the Weaving mechanics; if you perform a weaving during an Individual Scene, you still roll a single die and you still risk injury. Using a skill tied to one of the weaving dice is not the same as accepting a weaving die; when you use it as a skill, you’re using your skill at weaving to achieve a specific desired outcome.</p>
<h2 id="improving-your-skills" tabindex="-1">Improving Your Skills</h2>
<p>When you record a new skill in your journal, it begins with a rating of 0, meaning you gather no dice unless you push yourself or ask for help. You also begin with a set of skills when you create your character that begin with higher ratings.</p>
<p>Once a skill has been recorded, its rating improves by 1 immediately in any of the following circumstances:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Weaver’s Lesson:</strong> You roll a 6 on a weaving die while using a given skill.</li>
<li><strong>The Best Teacher:</strong> You roll a 1 on a weaving die while using a given skill.</li>
<li><strong>A Moment of Inspiration:</strong> You roll multiple 6 results while using a given skill during an Individual or Group Scene.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each skill can only benefit from one of these avenues of learning per session, and all three of the above methods of improvement must be used before a single method can be used again.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if your group is following a story arc, you can say that each skill can only benefit from each method once per story arc.</p>
<blockquote>
<h2 id="optional-rule%3A-universal-truth" tabindex="-1">Optional Rule: Universal Truth</h2>
<p>As an option, your group can decide that once a skill reaches a rating of 6, the character’s skill becomes a kind of universal truth for the world of the story. Mark the action with a star or something to let you know it’s special. Color it with a highlighter. It’s special now.</p>
<p>A skill that has been marked as a universal truth cannot be further improved.</p>
<p>When someone performs a weaving, they can instead ask you to use your universal truth. Roll a single die:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>1 (Bend):</strong> They call for your aid, but you are otherwise occupied, unable to lend your assistance. They <strong>mark an injury</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>2-5 (Weave):</strong> They call for your aid and you bring it, solving the challenge in front of you with ease.</li>
<li><strong>6 (Tear):</strong> They call for your aid and you bring it, but your overconfidence causes other problems that they must then deal with. They <strong>mark an injury</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="learning-new-skills" tabindex="-1">Learning New Skills</h2>
<p>If you want your character to be able to do something but you’ve never done it before and it’s not currently a skill, you can add it to your skill list with a rating of 0. When you use a skill with a rating of 0, you can’t hope to roll a 6, meaning that using it in an Individual Scene always results in a Complication.</p>
<p>Once you have the skill recorded, it can be improved like any other skill.</p>

        
            <h1>~ Sample Character Concepts</h1>
            <p>If you’d rather just pick something from a list, here are sixteen excellent character concepts that are all worth playing, and even come with some helpful roleplaying hooks to get you engaging with other players. If this is your first time playing a game like this where you’re telling a story with other people, I recommend picking one of these concepts to start.</p>
<p>In the interest of transparency, here’s how the concepts came together:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Aces</strong> are solitary characters, preferring their own company over the company of others.</li>
<li><strong>Jacks</strong> are troublemakers, acting on a continuous impulse to show the world its unseen potential.</li>
<li><strong>Queens</strong> are characters focused on the community they inhabit, looking for ways to bring people together.</li>
<li><strong>Kings</strong> are characters striving for systems of order, serving as reminders of the responsibilities everyone must share to take care of the world they live in.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can use those summaries as a first step to finding the concept you want, or you can start by looking at the suit that fits your needs best and go from there.</p>
<h2 id="spades" tabindex="-1">Spades</h2>
<p>Tools of the trade, weapons of war, these are the things that you craft or own or have personal relationship to that are outside of yourself, which are so much a part of you that they are an <em>extension</em> of yourself.</p>
<p>If Spades is your jam, you might dig these concepts:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Fighter (Jack of Spades)</strong> - When you’re cornered, everything you own becomes a deadly weapon.</li>
<li><strong>The Mercenary (Ace of Spades)</strong> - You’re here to do a job, not make friends. You follow your own rules.</li>
<li><strong>The Engineer (Queen of Spades)</strong> - Every part of the has its purpose, and its own needs as well. If you don’t maintain your tools, they’ll quickly crumble into dust.</li>
<li><strong>The Soldier (King of Spades)</strong> - You follow orders, and insist that others do the same. Best not to question it.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="clubs" tabindex="-1">Clubs</h2>
<p>Relationships with people and the world around you. You might have skills that address specific kinds of social interaction like Ordering Takeout, or you might have had to develop skills for dealing with specific people, like Officer Spangleburst.</p>
<p>If that sounds like you, try out these concepts:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Lover (Jack of Clubs)</strong> - You make friends with everybody, and everybody loves you in return. How can you possibly choose a best friend from all these lovely people?</li>
<li><strong>The Loner (Ace of Clubs)</strong> - Your friends are the wind, the tracks that lead you to your next dinner. Other people only get in the way.</li>
<li><strong>The Mother (Queen of Clubs)</strong> - Your favorite part of the day is bringing a smile to someone’s face when they’re having a rough time, helping them get back on their feet to try again when they fall down.</li>
<li><strong>The Gardener (King of Clubs)</strong> - You know what the world needs, and how to provide it. You can grow a full harvest from a handful of seeds, a forest from a single cutting.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="diamonds" tabindex="-1">Diamonds</h2>
<p>Talents of the mind, or wisdom gleaned from study or experience. You might be very good at Puzzles, or maybe you just Know About Reptiles.</p>
<p>If mental acuity is the thing you want to focus on, these might be good concepts for you:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Gambler (Jack of Diamonds)</strong> - You always know the odds, and sometimes the best days are when you beat them.</li>
<li><strong>The Construct (Ace of Diamonds)</strong> - You see yourself for what you are: a constructed individual made up of component parts that could be disassembled at any time. The world doesn’t fully understand you. Maybe it’s better that way.</li>
<li><strong>The Teacher (Queen of Diamonds)</strong> - People remember the lessons you give them. You might not know <em>everything</em>, but you know enough to help people find their way.</li>
<li><strong>The Architect (King of Diamonds)</strong> - You have a plan for that.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="hearts" tabindex="-1">Hearts</h2>
<p>Your body is your home, your vessel, your shelter. Take care of it, and it will take care of you. Maybe you can Climb really well. Maybe your Yearning is so strong it’s physical.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Dancer (Jack of Hearts)</strong> - You don’t so much walk around the ground as bounce off of it between aerials.</li>
<li><strong>The Immortal (Ace of Hearts)</strong> - You can’t die. Really. It’s uncanny.</li>
<li><strong>The Shield (Queen of Hearts)</strong> - If there’s danger, you’re ready to take the brunt of it in order to let others find safety.</li>
<li><strong>The Muscle (King of Hearts)</strong> - You can lift that car no problem; the challenge is not lifting it <em>too</em> good.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="ace-of-clubs%3A-the-loner" tabindex="-1">Ace of Clubs: The Loner</h3>
<p>The loner would always rather work alone, but for some reason keeps getting sucked into protecting these other people who don’t know what they’re doing. The loner does not make friends, they do not hug, they <em>definitely</em> do not trust people. The loner has developed a set of rules for survival that they can name at a moment’s notice, and they are all oddly specific.</p>
<p>The loner is always right about the things they have experience with. Somehow they have experience with everything.</p>
<p>The loner doesn’t like you. They don’t know why they still stick with you. They swear, they’re just helping you today. Tomorrow they’ll be gone. Really. This time they mean it.</p>
<p>Maybe the day after tomorrow. You certainly don’t need them. It’s them who’d be useless without you.</p>
<p><strong>Starting Skills:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Clubs (Strong):</strong>

<h3 id="ace-of-diamonds%3A-the-construct" tabindex="-1">Ace of Diamonds: The Construct</h3>
<p>Some people become; others are made. Maybe you weren’t literally built from pieces of metal or other materials, maybe you were just subjected to severe conditioning that stripped you of your humanity. Maybe you’ve just always had an awareness that we construct ourselves and the world constructs us, constantly. (Maybe everyone is constructed in this way, you’re just the only one who knows it.)</p>
<p>Whatever your method of construction, you’ve never felt at home in the community you’re in; there are rules and conditions of social behavior that to you seem either too obscure to understand.</p>
<p>That’s not to say you <em>never</em> know what rules are supposed to follow. But some rules are just too petty to bother following, much less learning in the first place.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Watch Out For Casual Ableism!</strong></p>
<p>If you are physically constructed, like a robot or cybernetic person, remember that you are still alive as long as you have agency. You might think in terms of programs and functions, or you might think in more abstract ways, but what makes you a Construct is the way you perceive yourself and your relationship to the world, not the way others perceive you.</p>
<p>On a related note, if your constuctionism comes from neurodivergence (ADHD, Autism, Schizophrenia, Bipolar Disorder, etc.), avoid behavioral stereotypes that are outside your experience. A lot of the ways neurodivergence is portrayed in popular media are, at best, a limited slice of people’s actual lives, and at worst can reinforce stigmas that lead to real harm.</p>

<p>Whether it’s a known fact of your existence that you cannot die, or just that you have unaccountably good luck when it comes to avoiding deadly scrapes, you cannot die, and this has given you a unique perspective on the ways of the world.</p>
<p>Pit full of acid? An inconvenience. Local baron sending soldiers into your town? A temporary frustration at most. You’ve seen how the world turns, and it always eventually turns again. It might have left you jaded, or cynical. But maybe it’s just that you know how things are, and that there’s no point fighting them. Just wait fifteen years; the weather will change on its own.</p>
<p>Even if it sometimes changes for the worse.</p>
<p>Maybe you really can’t die. Who did that to you? Did you do it to yourself? How long have you been walking this ball of dust? How many empires have you watched fall? When did you stop participating in history? When did you start avoiding its wake? How many lives have you lived, before you stopped caring about the world you’re stuck in?</p>
<p>Then again, maybe it’s more interesting if you’re not an inusfferably aloof asshole. A thousand years of perspective might make you care more, not less, because you see the ripples of actions people take—and the devastating inertia of actions people don’t.</p>

            <h1>Basics of Play</h1>
            <p>For both <em>Into the Grey</em> and <em>Deck Burner</em>, the cycle of play in Mnemonic follows a set pattern: Each player takes the lead in describing their character’s actions through a scene where their character has focus; then, once everyone has had a turn to lead, the group comes together to address the complications that may have arisen during each player’s individual scenes.</p>
<p>You can also use this framework to come up with new modes of play.</p>
<h2 id="individual-scenes" tabindex="-1">Individual Scenes</h2>
<p>Individual Scenes are ones in which a player’s character is doing something related to their particular needs and skill set. Your character might not be the only person <em>present</em> in the scene (and in fact I encourage you to invite other players into your scene to help you tell your character’s story), but in terms of action and mechanics, the Individual Scene is about one character: yours.</p>
<p>To play out the scene, follow this process, adding narrative details wherever and however you find them appropriate.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Choose a card from your hand or draw one from the deck. The face or number on the card tells you a bit of interpretive information about who’s in the scene with you or what the scene is about. Maybe the card just gives you a prop to play with; think of it as a story prompt, which you can follow as closely or loosely as you like.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3 id="card-prompts" tabindex="-1">Card Prompts</h3>
<p>When you play a card, either from your hand or from the top of the deck, begin by consulting the following table. You don’t <em>have</em> to do this step, but it may help for framing your scene.</p>

<li>
<p>Choose a skill for your character that matches the suit of the card you played.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3 id="asking-for-help" tabindex="-1">Asking for Help</h3>
<p>If you don’t have any skills that match the suit, you can ask another player to join you in the scene to assist you; then choose whatever skill you like. Have them choose a skill for their character to use. They won’t be rolling, but you’ll need to know what skill they used in the event of an <strong>injury</strong>; a player that assists you also assumes the same risks as you during the scene.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gather and roll a number of dice equal to the rating for the skill you chose. Keep the highest result.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the highest result is anything other than a 6, your actions result in a <strong>Complication</strong>, which is added to the Adversary’s pool for the next Group Scene.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(Optional) Perform a <strong>weaving</strong> to remove a Complication from the Adversary’s pool, or to give one other player an extra die in their next roll.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3 id="weaving" tabindex="-1">Weaving</h3>
<p>To perform a weaving, ask another player to choose an option from the Weaver’s Dice, and then roll a single die, and interpret the results:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>1 (Bend):</strong> The world barely moves to aid you, leaving you to overexert yourself in your efforts. <strong>Mark an injury.</strong></li>
<li><strong>2–3 (Weave):</strong> The world moves to your aid, meeting your need as readily as a friend.</li>
<li><strong>4–5 (Fray):</strong> The world leaps to your aid, with such force that you can barely contain its power.</li>
<li><strong>6 (Tear):</strong> The world overwhelms you, running amok with the full force of its power. <strong>Mark an injury.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>If another player is assisting you in this scene, they must mark an injury if you do.</p>
<h4 id="marking-injuries" tabindex="-1">Marking Injuries</h4>
<p>When you mark an <strong>injury</strong>, make a note of it next to the skill you used in that scene. Whenever you use a skill that has been marked with injuries, you roll <em>one fewer dice</em> for each injury marked. If this would mean you roll no dice, you <em>cannot use that skill.</em></p>
<p>Injuries are removed when the group <strong>spends time in recovery</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pass the focus of play to the next player, and lend them your attention as best you can.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once everyone has played out a scene, choose:</p>
<ul>
<li>End the game here</li>
<li>Play a <strong>Group Scene</strong></li>
<li>Play another round of Individual Scenes</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="group-scenes" tabindex="-1">Group Scenes</h2>
<p>In a Group Scene, everyone must work together to deal with the consequences of their actions. You cannot have a Group Scene without first laying the groundwork for everyone’s characters in Individual Scenes first. (Well, you could, but the stakes would be floppy and impersonal, and more practically the Adversary’s pool would be utterly empty of Complications).</p>
<p>To play a Group Scene:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Set the Stakes:</strong> Gather the Adversary’s dice - one for each Complication that has been accumulated thusfar.</li>
<li><strong>Make the Plan:</strong> Have each player choose a skill. For <em>Deck Burner</em>, first have everyone draw a card from the top of the deck; the skill they choose must match the suit of the card they draw.</li>
<li><strong>Execute the Plan:</strong> Have every player roll their dice separately, keeping their highest roll.</li>
<li><strong>Things Go Wrong:</strong> Roll the Adversary’s dice, keeping all of them.</li>
<li><strong>Sort it Out:</strong> Starting with the lowest roll, have each player describe their actions in the scene. If a Complication die interrupts the order, describe how things go wrong. When you get to the highest roll, determine:
<ul>
<li><strong>Victory:</strong> The players overcome the scene’s obstacles and resolve the scene on their own terms. The player with the highest roll describes how their action brings the scene to a close. Either end the game here, or play a new round of Individual Scenes.</li>
<li><strong>Defeat:</strong> The players are overwhelmed by the consequences of their actions, and are forced to live with them, at least for now. Every player <strong>marks an injury</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>After Defeat:</strong> Empty the Adversary’s pool of Complications; then, for each of the Adversary’s dice that rolled higher than <em>all</em> of the players’, add a Complication back to the pool. Then choose:
<ul>
<li><strong>Try Again:</strong> Play out another Group Scene, starting with <strong>Set the Stakes</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Regroup:</strong> Play a new round of Individual Scenes.</li>
<li><strong>Retreat:</strong> End the game here.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

            <h1>A Weaver&#39;s Almanac</h1>
            <p>Gameplay rules and setting lore for anyone looking to play out stories in the world of memory.</p>

        
            <h1>Recovering From Injuries</h1>
            <p>If someone in the group has <strong>injuries</strong>, you may want to spend some time recovering from those injuries so that they don’t make your lives more difficult. You can spend time in recovery at any time, wherever it makes sense within the context of the story you’re telling.</p>
<p>The steps to complete this process are simple:</p>
<ol>
<li>Remove one <strong>injury</strong> from any one skill that currently has at least one injury.</li>
</ol>
<p>That’s it. You don’t have to roll dice, you don’t have to spend a resource. You decide as a group that it’s important to take some time to rest and recover, and you do it. That’s all the mechanics of this game care about.</p>
<p>What <em>you</em> care about as players is entirely up to you. Do you have to go find a doctor to bind your wounds? Do you have to spend money on medicine? Are your injuries of a personal nature that require you to go find the person who wronged you and take revenge? That’s all story, and it belongs to you, and you can give it as much or as little space as it demands for you and your group.</p>
<p>For this game? For these rules? Do it when it makes sense. Clear an injury when you do it. Try to avoid doing it in the middle of a scene. That’s all you need to worry about <strong>doing correctly</strong>.</p>

        
            <h1>Free Play</h1>
            <p>Once you have a grasp of how individual and group scenes work in both <em>Into the Grey</em> and <em>Deck Burner</em>, you might begin to feel curious about what the game might be like without the constraints of those play modes. If that’s not you, that’s okay! Keep using the play modes provided; that’s what they’re there for. But if you find yourself chafing at the structured play of those modes, you might feel more at home with <em>Free Play</em>.</p>
<p>In this advanced mode, the guardrails are gone, the training wheels are off, and it’s just you and your group telling stories. What need have we for dice, then? Well, you could just go off and tell stories and never touch the dice, and that’s fine. But if you want to resolve specific beats or moments for individual characters, the basic rules still apply:</p>
<ol>
<li>Choose a skill that’s appropriate to the challenge of the moment.</li>
<li>Gather dice according to that skill’s rating.</li>
<li>Roll the dice.</li>
<li>If you roll a 6, you succeed without consequences. Otherwise, your actions complicate things for yourself or the group.</li>
</ol>
<p>If the situation you’re trying to resolve has to do with complications facing multiple or all characters in the group, that’s straight-forward too:</p>
<ol>
<li>Assess the complications and set aside one die for each one as the Adversary’s Pool.</li>
<li>Everyone chooses a skill that’s appropriate to their character’s actions in this scene.</li>
<li>Roll the dice.</li>
<li>Everyone works together to describe how their actions resolve the complications once and for all.
<blockquote>
<p>If the high roll came from the Adversary’s Pool, work together to describe how the complications overwhelmed the group, and what they plan to do next.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In this way, you don’t have to keep track of complications during individual scenes; just assess the situation when you get into a group scene and go from there.</p>
<p>This mode of play works best, I think, with the help of a Facilitator, but if your group is comfortable talking through scenes and moments this way, you might not need one.</p>

        
            <h1>Facilitating Play</h1>
            <p>For some groups, playing out the story freely without the intervention of a single authority figure is preferable. The rules are designed to support that style of play out of the box, so if that’s how your group likes to play, you should be able to do that without modification.</p>
<p>For groups who prefer to play with the aid of a facilitator, here are some things to consider. Remember that everything in this chapter is <em>optional</em>; if you don’t want a facilitator, your group doesn’t have to have one.</p>
<p>The facilitator’s job is to help the players navigate the rules. As facilitator, you can prepare reference materials for them, keep track of narrative events in your own journal, hand out dice as needed. You don’t need to control anything that happens within the story, or come up with an overarching narrative.</p>
<p>You can offer suggestions or ask questions, and if you and the other players all trust each other you can push players to go deeper in exploring a scene or moment. But be careful if you do this. Remember that your primary goal is to help the group play the game, not to play it for them.</p>
<blockquote>
<h2 id="the-importance-of-agency" tabindex="-1">The Importance of Agency</h2>
<p>The only person who decides what happens <em>to</em> a character is that character’s player. So if you’re facilitating play, you can ask a player what happens to their character; you may not <em>tell</em> them what happens to their character.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="be-the-weaver." tabindex="-1">Be the Weaver.</h2>
<p>Whenever a player asks for a weaving die, you are the person they ask, which means that you will always be the one to decide what types of memory are conjured when the characters in the story tap into the world’s magic. When the weaving die is cast, you are also the one to describe what happens as a result. The player is still responsible for describing how their own character is injured, if it comes to that.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you’re using the optional <em>Universal Truth</em> rule for skills, the players can then always offer their own universal truths as weaving dice.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="be-a-player." tabindex="-1">Be a Player.</h2>
<p>If the other players want you to take a more active role, I recommend setting up your own Player’s Journal, and treat the world or the story as its own character. Play out beats and scenes using skills that are appropriate for the narrative, like <strong>Dramatic Irony</strong>, or <strong>The Villain’s Speech</strong>.</p>
<p>The skills in your journal improve the same way that the other players’ skills do.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This might present some challenges if you see your role as adversarial to the players’ goals. I would recommend building skills that focus on ways that a villain’s aims are <em>thwarted</em>, if you use skills on behalf of a villain. <strong>The Villain’s Speech</strong>, for instance, might be framed as “if this roll comes out as a 6, the villain’s speech goes on long enough to give the players an opening.”</p>
<p>That way, a roll of less than 6 means that the speech doesn’t give the players an opening, and a <strong>Complication</strong> is added to the Adversary’s pool as normal.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the story becomes more complex, you might find it useful to create more than one “character” for the different aspects of the world that the players must deal with. You might have a whole journal dedicated to the city of Ironhold, for instance, which you only pull out when the players spend time there. You might have a journal that is all about the Mayor of Thornsville too, if they appear regularly in the story.</p>
<p>The balancing act here is that if you’re playing a character, whether it’s a single person or a city, you take turns the same way the players do. You might have additional opportunities to jump in and add details as facilitator, but when it comes to <em>doing things</em>, you still only get one turn.</p>
<h2 id="other-modifications-to-play" tabindex="-1">Other Modifications to Play</h2>
<p>Some possible modifications to play, if the group wants them:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Deck Burner:</strong> On each player’s turn, you draw the card from the deck and describe the scene for the player to respond to, building toward the moment when you ask the player: <em>What does your character do?</em></li>
<li><strong>Group Scenes:</strong> When it’s time to bring in all the complications, you decide how the complications come up and frame the scene where the players must deal with the consequences of their actions. Once you’ve gathered all of the dice for the Adversary’s Pool, ask them: <em>What do your characters do?</em></li>
<li><strong>Individual Scenes:</strong> When a player’s roll results in complications for their character or the group, you describe those complications where they extend beyond the characters themselves.</li>
<li><strong>Discussions:</strong> All discussions are led and facilitated by the facilitator, presenting each player with questions and asking the group when they’re ready to move on.</li>
<li><strong>Order of Play:</strong> You determine the order of turns, so that the players can be surprised if they want to be surprised.</li>
</ul>
<p>You don’t have to use all or any of these modifications; the facilitator can just as easily be <strong>The Person Who Reads the Rules When It’s Necessary</strong>.</p>

        
            <h1>Into the Grey</h1>
            <p>Into the Grey is a mode of play designed to establish the characters and touchstones of the story your group is telling; the more cards you play, the more the world is filled in around your characters. By the end of the game, my expectation is that your group will have developed a comprehensive knowledge of the group’s narrative. I’m not expecting you to fill in the whole world this way; just the parts of the world that are relevant to the story you’re telling.</p>
<p>For this variation, you’ll need enough dice for everyone, as well as a deck of cards split into three piles:</p>
<ul>
<li>Face Cards (Ace, Jack, Queen, and King), shuffled</li>
<li>Number Cards (2 through 10), shuffled</li>
<li>Jokers (there should only be two of them)</li>
</ul>
<p>Deal the face cards out to the players one at a time until none are left; then deal out the numbered cards in the same way. Deal out the Jokers last.</p>
<p>To play, follow this pattern of phases:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Exploration:</strong> Have each player play an Individual Scene, choosing a card from their hand to frame each scene.
<blockquote>
<p>After everyone has played a scene, if there are no Complications, repeat the <strong>Exploration</strong> phase. Otherwise, continue to <strong>Resolution</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><strong>Resolution:</strong> Play out a single Group Scene, using the accumulated Complications as fuel. Have each player choose a card from their hand to frame their actions in the scene.</li>
</ul>
<p>Continue this pattern as desired, or until there are no cards left to play. When the cards are gone, that means your group has established everything you need in order to form a cohesive understanding of the current story arc. You can reshuffle the deck and play again with that understanding, or you can play <em>Deck Burner</em> to resolve a more specific conflict.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You will probably not be able to play through the whole deck in a single play session. To make things easier, I recommend having everyone write down what cards they have in their journal, and crossing each card out as it’s played; that way, if you need to pick up the same game later, you won’t have to physically keep track of the cards. You don’t even need to use the same deck.</p>
</blockquote>

        
            <h1>Deck Burner</h1>
            <p>Deck Burner is a mode of play designed to swiftly resolve a conflict. I’m personifying that conflict with the term <strong>Adversary</strong> here, but the conflict in each story will be different, and might not involve a specific person. My hope with this framework is that by the end of the game, your group will have either <em>overcome</em> the Adversary, or deepen their resolve against it.</p>
<p>For this variation, all you need is a shuffled deck of cards and enough dice for everyone to roll their skills.</p>
<p>To play, follow this pattern of phases:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Escalation:</strong> Have each player play an Individual Scene, drawing a card from the top of the deck to frame each scene.</li>
<li><strong>Confrontation:</strong> Play out a single Group Scene, using the accumulated Complications and your knowledge of the Adversary as fuel. Have each player draw a card from the top of the deck to frame their actions in the scene.</li>
</ul>
<p>At the end of the Confrontation, if the players have the high roll, decide:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Adversary has been defeated! End the game here.</li>
<li>The Adversary has retreated to a more strategic position! Repeat the pattern again, beginning with <strong>Escalation</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Need to pick it up later? That’s okay! You don’t need to keep track of what cards were played for this; just shuffle the deck anew next time, and pick up the story where you left off.</p>
<p>For pacing, I recommend always starting with Escalation; that way you don’t have to keep track of Complications between sessions, and you can track them during the session however works best for you and your group.</p>

            <h1>The First Gathering</h1>
            <p>The First Gathering is about introducing everyone’s characters; it’s meant to be short enough that you can play it at the end of the character creation process, or just before jumping into another mode like <em>Into the Grey</em>. If you’ve played <em>Cracks in the Mirror</em>, this ritual will feel very familiar.</p>
<p>This process will bring the characters you’ve made into the story. How this will work is this:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Introducing Your Character:</strong> Each player goes through the entire process to introduce their character.</li>
<li><strong>Developing the Group Dynamic:</strong> Once everyone’s character is present, they will meet each other.</li>
<li><strong>Now It’s A Party:</strong> Once everyone has met, they will find a reason to work or travel or live together.</li>
</ol>
<p>If the players created their characters before meeting to play as a group, give yourselves permission to take a bit longer with this ritual; otherwise, it’s okay to gloss over details that everyone is already familiar with from the character creation process.</p>
<p>If this is not the first time your group is playing The First Gathering with these characters, you can use this ritual as a way to initiate a new story arc, allowing the players to bring their characters to whatever narrative you’re about to explore together.</p>
<h2 id="before-we-begin%3A-the-boundary" tabindex="-1">Before We Begin: The Boundary</h2>
<p>When we tell stories, we inevitably leave some details out, some rooms unexplored, some doors closed. We do this for our own safety and for the safety of those around us. If you haven’t already done so with your gruop, take a moment now to discuss: What is a boundary you will not cross in this story? How close to it are you willing to wander before you turn away?</p>
<p>Your boundary can be something your character would want respected, or it can be something you care about personally. For example, Dee has a fear of heights, but their character does not. They might say, “I’d like to set a boundary on detailed descriptions of vertigo or other feelings of being up high. We can go to high places, but I as a player don’t want to experience that feeling in my imagination.”</p>
<p>You can set more than one boundary, and you can add more as the story progresses or as you think of them. If privacy is a concern, you may want to consider some form of anonymization, such as a shared digital document or a trusted facilitator.</p>
<p>Respecting boundaries is about more than just not crossing the line; it’s about knowing when a boundary needs to remain entirely outside the scope of the story, even in reference. If your character has a pet and you want to set a boundary around that pet’s safety, you may want to establish that as a convention of play: that this pet will never come to harm, and will never even be perceived to be in any danger, no matter the stakes of the scene.</p>
<p>Once the boundaries are set, we can begin. We can adjust them at any time as needed, but now we have enough to get started.</p>
<h2 id="introducing-your-character" tabindex="-1">Introducing Your Character</h2>
<p>Answer each of the following questions to describe your character’s outlook, physical appearance, circumstances, or present mood.For each question, either choose a response from the available options or invent your own.</p>
<h3 id="the-silhouette" tabindex="-1">The Silhouette</h3>
<p>When you enter the scene, we don’t see your face just yet; just the outline of your body.</p>
<p>What are you wearing that changes the shape of your silhouette?</p>
<ul>
<li>A dress or skirt.</li>
<li>A suit of armor.</li>
<li>A cloak or cape.</li>
<li>A hat.</li>
<li>A scarf.</li>
<li>Nothing. My garb is fitted to my form.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Optional:</em> What does your silhouette remind us of when we first see you?</p>
<h3 id="the-form" tabindex="-1">The Form</h3>
<p>As we see more of you, we notice details about your body that will help us form a mental image of you throughout the story.</p>
<p>Which of the following, if any, best describes your physical form?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Drake:</strong> A winged, reptilian form that calls to mind the memory of dragons, for those who are old enough to remember them.</li>
<li><strong>Fey:</strong> A form that is ever-changing.</li>
<li><strong>Gemfolk:</strong> A form made of living crystal.</li>
<li><strong>Human:</strong> A mammalian primate form that is mostly hairless and usually walks on two legs.</li>
<li><strong>Spiderkin:</strong> An insectoid form that weaves tapestries of silk.</li>
<li><strong>Sun Child:</strong> A constructed form made of wood, metal, and other seemingly inert materials.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-mask" tabindex="-1">The Mask</h3>
<p>As you step out of the Grey, the wandering mists that are scattered across the world of Mnemonic, your form resolves and we see you clearly, wearing the mask that protects you from the Grey’s more dangerous effects.</p>
<p>What is your mask made of?</p>
<ul>
<li>Wood.</li>
<li>Stone.</li>
<li>Crystal.</li>
<li>Metal.</li>
<li>Glass.</li>
<li>Cloth.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Optional:</em> Describe your mask. What is its shape? What colors make up its design? Is it plain or decorated? Does it cover your mouth? Your eyes? Your head?</p>
<h3 id="the-lie" tabindex="-1">The Lie</h3>
<p>Now that we have a picture of you in our mind, let’s find out a little more about who you are.</p>
<p>What lie has your community tried to make you believe about yourself?</p>
<ul>
<li>I speak too much.</li>
<li>I don’t try hard enough.</li>
<li>I’m not smart.</li>
<li>I’m dangerous.</li>
<li>I’m better off alone.</li>
<li>I’m only as valuable as the things I create.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Remember: This lie isn’t true for you.</em></p>
<h3 id="the-source" tabindex="-1">The Source</h3>
<p>Where do you derive your strength?</p>
<ul>
<li>From the company of others.</li>
<li>From the work I do.</li>
<li>From spite for those who did me wrong.</li>
<li>From knowledge of the goal ahead.</li>
<li>From the world around me.</li>
<li>From nothing; I haven’t found it yet.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-power" tabindex="-1">The Power</h3>
<p>Nobody just stands there in the mists looking mysterious. Everyone’s doing something. What is it that you are doing, when you first appear?</p>
<p>Choose one of the following based on how many Complications are currently in the Adversary’s pool:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>You Do Something Impressive:</strong> You spot someone in need of help, and use one of the skills associated with your strong suit to help them. <br>
<em>Remove a <strong>Complication</strong> from the Adversary’s pool.</em></li>
<li><strong>You Do Something Necessary:</strong> You’re in trouble when we first see you, but you quickly get out of it.</li>
<li><strong>You Do Something Foolish:</strong> You’re in way over your head, probably because of something you did.<br>
<em>Add a <strong>Complication</strong> to the Adversary’s pool.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Everyone’s good at something. What are you good at? Tell us your <strong>Strong Suit</strong>, and the two <strong>skills</strong> you’ve chosen that are associated with that suit.</p>
<h3 id="the-name" tabindex="-1">The Name</h3>
<p>We see you, we know you. We just need to know what to call you, in the context of this story. What <strong>name</strong> should we use?</p>
<h3 id="wrap-it-up" tabindex="-1">Wrap It Up</h3>
<p>Give us one more detail to get excited about this character, and then give the focus to the next player so that they can introduce their character too.</p>
<h2 id="developing-the-group-dynamic" tabindex="-1">Developing the Group Dynamic</h2>
<p>Now that each of you has a character, it’s time to place them into context with each other. Take a moment to breathe, drink some water, do some physical exercising to re-orient yourself, and then come back and proceed.</p>
<p>As a group, discuss each of the questions below to imagine the circumstances of your group coming together. You might not all have met on the same day, and that’s okay; imagine the meetings in bits and pieces, scrape them together and see how they fit. If you need to adjust the timing of events, you can do so.</p>
<h3 id="the-place" tabindex="-1">The Place</h3>
<p>Where are we right now? Choose one of the following locations, or come up with your own:</p>
<ul>
<li>A busy city marketplace</li>
<li>A quiet gathering</li>
<li>A festival</li>
<li>A road to somewhere</li>
<li>The middle of nowhere</li>
<li>A boat</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Optional:</em> Does this place have a name?</p>
<h3 id="the-reason" tabindex="-1">The Reason</h3>
<p>Why are each of us here?</p>
<ul>
<li>To find something or someone</li>
<li>To escape from something or someone</li>
<li>To experience the place itself</li>
<li>To get to somewhere else</li>
<li>I was lost</li>
<li>I don’t remember</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Optional:</em> If you went there for a reason, did you complete your task? If not, what stopped you?</p>
<h3 id="the-tether" tabindex="-1">The Tether</h3>
<p>Using your characters’ <strong>roleplaying hooks</strong>, figure out the rest. How do you engage with each other? Who speaks first? Do you all like each other right away, or does it take some time to get comfortable?</p>
<h3 id="the-inciting-event" tabindex="-1">The Inciting Event</h3>
<p>Something happens, unrelated to anything any of you did, that draws all of your attention. Add a <strong>Complication</strong> to the Adversary’s pool, and discuss:</p>
<ul>
<li>What just happened?</li>
<li>What are we going to do about it?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="now-it%E2%80%99s-a-party" tabindex="-1">Now It’s A Party</h2>
<p>When you introduced your characters, you were all doing something. Now it’s time to see how those somethings come together. Add them to the Inciting Event, and we’ve got ourselves a party.</p>
<p>Quickly build a <strong>Group Scene</strong> using the pool of Complications you accumulated when you introduced your characters:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Set the Stakes:</strong> Gather one die for each of the Complications in the Adversary’s pool.</li>
<li><strong>Make the Plan:</strong> Have each player choose a skill. Since we’re not using the deck yet, anyone can choose whichever they like.</li>
<li><strong>Execute the Plan:</strong> Have each player roll a number of dice equal to the rating of the skill they chose, keeping only the highest roll.</li>
<li><strong>Things Go Wrong:</strong> Roll the Adversary’s dice, and keep them separate.</li>
<li><strong>Sort It Out:</strong> Starting with the lowest roll, have each player describe their actions in the scene. If a Complication die interrupts the order, describe how things go wrong. When you get to the highest roll, determine Victory or Defeat depending on whether the highest roll belonged to the Adversary or one of the players:
<ul>
<li><strong>Victory:</strong> The players overcome the scene’s obstacles and resolve the scene on their own terms. The player with the highest roll describes how their action brings the scene to a close.</li>
<li><strong>Defeat:</strong> The players are overwhelmed by the consequences of their actions, and are forced to live with them, at least for now.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Whether the scene ended in Victory or Defeat, the game ends here. Take a moment to wrap things up, discuss what your characters intend to do next, and what you plan to do next.</p>

        
            <h1>Laid to Rest</h1>
            <p>Sometimes the tools we bring with us aren’t enough. Sometimes magic isn’t enough. Sometimes we don’t all make it back.</p>
<p>Sometimes none of us do.</p>
<p>If one of our characters has left the story we’re telling (for any reason), this is the ritual for bidding that character a last farewell.</p>
<p>For the purposes of this ritual, the player of the character who left the story will be referred to as the <strong>Weaver</strong>. When the ritual refers to the players, that does not include the Weaver. (If more than one player’s character left the story at the same time, they can share the Weaver responsibility, or you can play this ritual once for each of them.)</p>
<p><em>(We can also use this ritual to bid farewell to a Story Arc we’ve completed, or a place we’re leaving behind. If no one left, choose one player to serve as Weaver for this ritual.)</em></p>
<p>You will need a freshly shuffled deck of cards. You will not need dice. Expect this ritual to last at least a couple of hours.</p>
<ol>
<li>The Weaver deals one card at a time, face down, to each player until the deck is depleted. The players pile the cards in front of themselves, but do not look at them.</li>
<li>One at a time, each player draws a card from their pile, speaks a memory of the lost character inspired by the card (see <em>Drawing Memories</em> for details); then they lay the card carefully in the center of the table.</li>
<li>When all of the cards have been laid to rest at the center of the table, the Weaver asks the players to close their eyes. The Weaver can play music here, or read a poem, or let the moment linger in silence.</li>
<li>While the players have their eyes closed, the Weaver gathers the cards together, places them back in their box, and carefully sets the box on the table.</li>
<li>When the Weaver is ready, they ask the players to open their eyes.</li>
</ol>
<p>When the ritual is done, if the Weaver wishes to introduce a new character to the story, they may; follow the procedure of The First Gathering to add this new character to the group.</p>

<h2 id="when-no-one-comes-back" tabindex="-1">When No One Comes Back</h2>
<p>If all of our characters leave the story at once, we can use this ritual for each of them, or we can do it once for our whole group. When it’s done, we can start a new story, or leave the game behind us.</p>

        
            <h1>Game Face</h1>
            <p>This is a ritual for use when Travelers engage in a discrete contest of skill. This can be anything from physical competitions, sport combat, or even something like a game of cards. Specifically, this ritual is meant with the possibility of Player Character vs Player Character play in mind. With it, any fight is a conversation, a duel of wits, a contest, and most importantly: engaging for everyone involved.</p>
<h2 id="what-you%E2%80%99ll-need" tabindex="-1">What You’ll Need</h2>
<p>Game Face is a dice-based ritual, for which you’ll need:</p>
<ul>
<li>A six-sided die (d6)</li>
<li>Two eight-sided dice (d8’s)</li>
<li>One twelve-sided die (d12)</li>
<li>Something opaque that you can use to hide your die, like a cup or mug.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each participating character’s different Suits are assigned a <strong>Suit Die</strong> value:</p>
<ul>
<li>Strong Suit = d12</li>
<li>Weak Suit = d6</li>
<li>Remaining two suits = d8</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-the-ritual-works" tabindex="-1">How the Ritual Works</h2>
<p>Game Face consists of three rounds of contested die rolls. The character who wins two out of the three rounds first is declared the victor.</p>
<p>At the start of each round, participating players select one of their Suit Dice to roll, representing the kinds of approach or skills they will use to gain the upper hand in this round of the contest. Any one die can be used for any roll, but each <strong>Suit Die</strong> may only be used once per three-round ritual.</p>
<p>Before rolling, both players describe the approach your character is using to claim victory. This description should <em>roughly</em> correspond to the Suit (pp.2 of the Core Rules) each die is assigned to. A player whose 1st round die is assigned to Clubs wouldn’t describe leaping over an obstacle, for instance.  \</p>
<p><strong>However.</strong></p>
<p>Within the confines of that, players are encouraged to be as straightforward as they wish, or to describe their action in a way that attempts to bluff or misdirect their adversary. In this scenario, it may be prudent to assign one player who is not participating in the current ritual as a  deciding voice in the case of a dispute.</p>
<p>After both players describe their approach, each rolls simultaneously in secret, hiding their roll using their object of choice. Once both rolls are made, the die result is revealed and the player with the higher die roll is deemed the victor for that round of the ritual. The dice used for that round remain out on the table for the duration, in clear view of all players.</p>
<p>In addition, if a player that wins a round for having the higher die roll _also _has a higher total when all their rolled dice are added up, they gain the added benefit of a +1 bonus to their next roll.</p>
<p>The example on the next page will help clarify this:</p>
<blockquote>
<h3 id="example-of-%2B1-bonus-scenario%3A" tabindex="-1">Example of +1 Bonus Scenario:</h3>
<p>Player 1: Rolls a 5 on a d6
Player 2: Rolls a 4 on a d6</p>
<p>Player 1 wins the first round, securing a +1 bonus to their Round 2 roll. However, this does not always apply, as in this example of a Round 2 roll, taking into account the results above:</p>
<p>Player 1: Rolls a 3 on a d12, plus 1 for a total of 4.
Player 2: Rolls an 5 on a d8.</p>
<p>Even with the +1 from the first round, Player 1 can’t overcome crummy luck. Player 2 wins the second round, but because their total across two rounds (4+5=9) isn’t higher than Player 1’s (5+4=9), no +1 bonus is issued for the tie-breaking final round.</p>
</blockquote>

        
            <h1>Character Creation</h1>
            <p>Before you get together with your group to play Mnemonic, I recommend taking a look at the character concepts in this chapter to start thinking about what kind of character you want to play. If none of them are a perfect fit, you can also build a character concept from scratch using the rules provided below.</p>
<p>In order to play Mnemonic, you’ll need a character whose story you’re interested in telling. Remember: in Mnemonic, we don’t play heroes; we play storytellers, telling the stories of heroes. Because of this, the character you imagine will likely begin larger-than-life, borrowing traits and aesthetics from your own culture and the stories you’re already familiar with. The character will develop as you tell their story into something more life-like. But it always begins with a <strong>concept</strong>.</p>
<p>Your character concept gives you something to hold onto while you’re figuring out who your character is. It tells you a bit about their outlook and also provides some ideas for how to play them constructively within a group (even if the character themselves would rather be alone).</p>
<p>From a mechanical perspective, your concept tells you your character’s <strong>strong suit</strong> and their two <strong>standard suits</strong>, along with your character’s four <strong>starting skills</strong>. Those are the pieces you absolutely need in order to play the game, so if you just want to jump into the game, pick a concept and you’re good to go.</p>
<p>That said, if you read through the sample character concepts in this chapter and none of them feel quite right, you can use the rules below to create your very own concept from scratch. Just follow the steps as they’re presented to build the character you want.</p>
<p>Once you start playing, you may find that the concept you’ve built or chosen no longer fits. That’s okay! You can rename skills or even your entire concept as you like to match the character you end up playing. Characters evolve over time too; your chosen concept is just a starting point.</p>
<h2 id="building-a-concept" tabindex="-1">Building a Concept</h2>
<p>If none of the sample concepts provided fit the character you want to play, you can create something new. The process is simple:</p>
<ol>
<li>Choose one suit from one of the following, and record it in your character journal as your character’s <strong>strong suit</strong>.
<ul>
<li>Hearts</li>
<li>Diamonds</li>
<li>Spades</li>
<li>Clubs</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Choose two other suits for your character from the remaining suits, and record them in your character journal as your character’s <strong>standard suits</strong>.</li>
<li>Record the remaining suit in your character journal as your character’s <strong>weak suit</strong>.</li>
<li>In your character journal, under your character’s <strong>strong suit</strong>, record two skills with a <strong>rating</strong> of <em>2</em>.
<blockquote>
<p>You can name your skills whatever you want; think about the kinds of things you want your character to be able to do, and give them names that feel personal to your character.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>In your character journal, under each of your character’s <strong>standard suits</strong>, record one skill with a <strong>rating</strong> of <em>1</em>.</li>
<li>(Optional) Give your concept a name.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once you’ve done all of that, your character is ready to play. All you need to do is <strong>flesh out the details</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="fleshing-out-the-details" tabindex="-1">Fleshing Out the Details</h2>
<p>Once you have a concept built, all you need to do is make sure your character journal is ready for play:</p>
<ul>
<li>Every suit should have space for adding more skills</li>
<li>Every skill should have space for marking injuries and a rating</li>
<li>Your character should have a <strong>name</strong> and, if appropriate, some designated pronouns to help you and everyone else refer to them correctly during play. You can come up with an alias too if you like.</li>
</ul>
<p>You may want to create some sections in your journal for different kinds of notes, such as Injury lists, or details about the world. But the basics should fit on one or two pages.</p>
<h2 id="naming-your-character" tabindex="-1">Naming Your Character</h2>
<p>Names come from all sorts of things. You can use names you’re familiar with, or you can make something up. If you need some specific inspiration, though, I’ve found that the following name categories are a good starting point.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Names Based On Plants:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Willow</li>
<li>Ash</li>
<li>Lily</li>
<li>Rose</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Names Based On Objects:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Spindle</li>
<li>Blade</li>
<li>Wheels</li>
<li>Cog</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Names Based On Weather:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Zephyr</li>
<li>Rain</li>
<li>Thunder</li>
<li>Tide</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Names Based On Animals:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Mouse</li>
<li>Tiger</li>
<li>Cricket</li>
<li>Weasel</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

        
            <h1>Play Modes</h1>
            <p>Once you’ve all made characters and are ready to begin telling their story, it’s time to choose a mode of play. In <em>Mnemonic</em> there are four such modes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>First Gathering:</strong> A short introduction to everyone’s characters, letting the players introduce their characters into the story.</li>
<li><strong>Into the Grey:</strong> An extended exploration of the story’s key elements, from people and places to important objects and events. This mode is intended to last multiplay play sessions.</li>
<li><strong>Deck Burner:</strong> A fast-paced resolution to the story’s main conflict, or one of its many smaller conflicts.</li>
<li><strong>Laid to Rest:</strong> A somber ritual for saying good-bye to a character, or to the story as a whole.</li>
<li><strong>Game Face:</strong> A short game for settling scores between players’ characters.</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to play <em>Mnemonic</em>, everyone will need to have a character journal prepared, as well as some numbered six-sided dice ready to roll (two per person should be plenty, at least for the first time you play). Your group will also need a standard 54-card poker deck, which will need to be shuffled and/or divided as needed by the mode you choose.</p>
<p>If you’re not sure what story you want to tell, the <em>First Gathering</em> can help you discover that through play; or you can choose one of the many Story Arcs provided within the <strong>Mnemonic Setting</strong>.</p>

        
            <h1>Advanced Rules</h1>
            <p>Mnemonic is a game of collaborative storytelling. Each player is primarily responsible for the actions of a single character in the story, and all players collectively share the responsibility of describing the world and building a story around their characters. The rules presented in this chapter are designed to give you just enough structure to play out a loosely structured story, driven by the needs of your group.</p>
<p>If you find that your group prefers to play with a more rigid session structure, the <a href="/play-structures/">Structured Play</a> chapter provides some frameworks that may help.</p>
<p>Regardless of how you play, you can play with or without the aid of a facilitator—someone whose sole responsibility is to guide the players through the story, ask clarifying questions, and (when appropriate and with permission from the other players) take the reins of secondary or adversarial characters to build a larger story. There are rules and guidelines provided in this book to help the facilitator, or to offer guidance to players if no facilitator is present.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we’ll discuss the process of creating a character in Mnemonic, recording their details, and developing their skills.</p>

        
            <h1>The Mercenary</h1>
            <p>All you know is violence. Your only friends are the tools of violence. They’re the only friends you need.</p>
<p>People ask you how you sleep at night. You don’t. Why would you need to? Sleep is for those who have dreams. All your dreams are violence.</p>
<p>Your violence might not be physical. Your tools might not have blades or cannons. But your path is one of destruction, and if you stay on it too long, you’ll inevitably destroy yourself as well.</p>

            <h1>The Engineer</h1>
            <p>Every tool has its purpose, every gear and axle a place in the mechanisms that make the world work. When you build a system, you know exactly how it works, and when something breaks, you know how to fix it.</p>
<p>This might leave you somewhat less prepared for dealing with other <em>people</em>, but with the right tool in your hand, you can accomplish anything.</p>

            <h1>The Fighter</h1>
            <p>You’re a fighter. You fight. It’s what you do best; why shouldn’t you do it? It’s not that you want to hurt people or break things; this is just how you express yourself. Or something. Look, we don’t have to overcomplicate things, right? You’re a fighter. You fight.</p>
<p>Some people fight with words, or with ideas. For you, it’s all about the weapon in your hand. And you’re <em>good</em> with that weapon. And people just…ugh, they just want you to <em>stop</em> and <em>think</em> and <em>wait for things</em> and <em>come oooon</em> that’s <em>boring</em>.</p>
<p>Fighters fight, it’s just how you are. If only everyone would just stop yelling at you.</p>

            <h1>The Social Construct</h1>
            <p>Some people have no trouble existing in the world, living their lives, being themselves. It’s not so easy for you. Whether because your insides are literally made of machinery or because your mind just works differently from what people expect, you have always felt that on some level you can’t Be Yourself in the world; instead, you’ve learned to model what others expect of you, to be who they want you to be, to hide who or what you really are.</p>
<p>Makes it hard to figure out who you really are on the inside, or who you want to be. But at least this way you can survive.</p>

            <h1>The Immortal</h1>
            <p>Whether it’s a known fact of your existence that you cannot die, or just that you have unaccountably good luck when it comes to avoiding deadly scrapes, you cannot die, and this has given you a unique perspective on the ways of the world.</p>
<p>Pit full of acid? An inconvenience. Local baron sending soldiers into your town? A temporary frustration at most. You’ve seen how the world turns, and it always eventually turns again. It might have left you jaded, or cynical. But maybe it’s just that you know how things are, and that there’s no point fighting them. Just wait fifteen years; the weather will change on its own.</p>
<p>Even if it sometimes changes for the worse.</p>
<p>Maybe you really can’t die. Who did that to you? Did you do it to yourself? How long have you been walking this ball of dust? How many empires have you watched fall? When did you stop participating in history? When did you start avoiding its wake? How many lives have you lived, before you stopped caring about the world you’re stuck in?</p>

            <p>You have your orders, and more importantly you know why you’re following them. Maybe your instructions come from an employer, or a commander. Maybe they come from somewhere inside yourself. But you don’t take the job if you don’t know what you’re doing, and why you’re doing it. You’ve made that mistake before.</p>

            <h1>Fire</h1>
            <p>Most people have memories of fire. The lights of a dozen candles on a cake. The fleeting warmth of a bed of hot coals at a campsite. Fire carries the smell of woodsmoke, of rendered cooking fat. Fire can form memories of home, of brightness and wonder, of celebration.</p>
<p>Not every fire is a comfort. When it comes too quickly, or spreads beyond control, fire can also bring fear, devastation, loss, sorrow. Memories of pain, of burns that left scars.</p>
<p>Some memories, stored in pictures or mementos, refuse to burn, despite our rituals and speeches. This is what it means to hold the fire in your hands, to carry its potential, and its danger. Burn too brightly, and you can set the world ablaze. Let the flames flicker and die, and all you have left is the cold and the night.</p>
<p>Roll the fire die when you need comfort in the dark, or when you need to burn away the overgrowth. Respect its power, or be consumed by it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you weave fire, consider the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>What images flash before your eyes when the fire manifests? Is the picture clear, or distorted? Is it your memory, or someone else’s?</li>
<li>Why do the flames answer your call?</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

        
            <h1>Template</h1>
            <p>The opening text for your new die should contain three body-length paragraphs, each paragraph addressing one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>What does it mean for the player to hold this die in their hand? (2-3 sentences)</li>
<li>Place this die in context with the rest of the world. What does its power represent within the world of Mnemonic? (2-3 sentences)</li>
<li>What happens when the player rolls this die? What power does it hold?</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>When you weave with [this die], consider the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ask the player to frame the die in context of their own character’s memories.</li>
<li>Ask the player why their character rolls this die in particular. The character might not know themselves.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

        
            <h1>Grey</h1>
            <p>We think of the Grey as this amorphous, wandering cloud of fog that rolls across the world. Thicker than mists, carrying with it feelings of uncertainty, and omen. We try not to think of the Mage who took its name, the one who used its power to end the dominion of the dragons.</p>
<p>We try not to think about the cost of that power.</p>
<p>When you hold the Grey Die in your hand, a creeping doubt immediately enters your mind: what are you doing? who are you becoming? why are you holding this? is it too late to stop?</p>
<p>The Grey Die spells doom. Sometimes it is a quiet doom, a cloud that hangs over one’s day. Sometimes it is…less subtle.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you weave with the Grey, consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>Did you do this?</li>
<li>Why did you do this?</li>
<li>What other choice did you have?</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Remember: you can always rewrite the story to omit the result of your weaving if it is too painful to bear.</em></p>

        
            <h1>Metal</h1>
            <p>The history of Metal.</p>
<p>What it means to roll the Metal Die.</p>

        
            <h1>Sand</h1>
            <p>The Sand Die is a die of inevitability, of time, of fate: the vast and endless infinities of the sand-scoured desert, motes of cosmic dust swirling in the timeless mists of a nebula, jewelled grains filtering through the polished glass of the tiniest hourglass. It is the power of the insignificant and uncountable, the weight of nothing, the foundation of everything.</p>
<p>To hold the Sand Die in your hand is to grasp your fate in your hand: a single grain in the hourglass, light as a feather, heavy as a mountain. To roll it, to feel it bounce in your hand is to seize the sandstorm, to grasp the infinite desert, to bend time and space to your will, to pluck the very stars from the night sky. To release it is to allow fate to take its course, to let time and space and infinity slip through your fingers, to scatter to the four winds as they may. Light as a feather. Heavy as a mountain.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you weave with the Sand Die, consider the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>What singular grain of fate do you try to seize? What do you push aside to grasp your goal?</li>
<li>When you seize the universe within your hand, what slips through your fingers?</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

        
            <h1>Granite</h1>
            <blockquote>
<p>A pinkish brown block. Its surface is scattered with white patterns, looking like mortar between bricks. Some kind of dark plant matter has been rubbed into the uneven scratches in its sides.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is no weight so unsettling as the responsibility. Those who wield this die must be able to speak for others, aid others, build for others, until they eventually give out. But there is no warmth greater than community, and as your mind wanders to the cost of such power, there is comforting heat spreading from the die. “You are not alone”.</p>
<p>It is said that the first weavers of this die came from the great packs of the West, using its power to give them fire when the world was coated with ice. Others say it was the fishers of the Sodden Isle, building their great stone forts using its power. But the stories, however disparate, unite in one common theme: use this, and your people survive.</p>
<p>How much would you sacrifice to ensure the survival of a home? A community? Or even your family?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you weave with Granite, consider the following:&gt;</p>
<ul>
<li>What gives way in you to make this possible? Do knees buckle, does blood flow freer? The die is granite. The Weaver is not.</li>
<li>What is it about these people that need your protection? As you glance into their faces, how does their pain reveal itself?</li>
<li>When the die eventually slips from your fingers, to meet the need of another, are you relieved? Or distraught?</li>
</ul>

            <h1>Gold</h1>
            <p>With the cool feeling of Gold in your hand and at your side, the world is yours to purchase. Grab me, roll me, and never let me go to waste, Weaver, for we all know the way of the world. Gold is a fickle friend, there for those who have me already but ever-scarce to those who need me most.</p>
<p>Ease your mind! Ease your heart! You’re a good one, are you not? You help people. Let me help you! That’s what you’ll do with money, isn’t it? Use me for good. Ease the burdens of your friends, your communities. That’s what everyone always does… right?</p>
<p>Roll me when you need something. Anything. Let me ease that hollowness within you. Fill your aching heart and empty stomach with my bounty.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you weave with the beauteous shine of Gold, consider the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do you summon me by memories of plenty or memories of want? Which side of the coin defines your relationship with me?</li>
<li>I was the easiest way, was I not? So much less dangerous to you than other options. And the cost, well, you never have to pay it. Take a moment to thank me, Weaver. You’re ever so welcome.</li>
<li>I always take my cut. My boon comes with a modest price. Gold does not give; Gold loans. The nature of wealth is that all aid comes with a price tag. But do not blame me, and do not question it. Ask, instead—what do you offer me back?</li>
</ul>

            <h1>Wind (Revised)</h1>
            <p>The Wind Die, like the element that grants it that title, is volatile on its own, but always defined by what it can bring with it to any situation. It can take a ship to shore, but only if there are sails to catch it; it can stir up a blazing inferno, but only if the spark was there for it to spread.</p>
<p>In much the same way, the Wind Die accentuates the memories of dice that are rolled alongside them, giving way to deeper magic and wider prophetic revelation when read accurately.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you weave with The Wind, consider the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>What sounds or scents come to mind when the wind blows past you? What memories are those sensations bonded to?</li>
<li>What was the last thing that the wind has brought to you, or taken from you?</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="advanced-rule" tabindex="-1">Advanced Rule</h2>
<p>If you roll the Wind Die alongside any other weaving die, the wind amplifies the other weaving’s effects.</p>
<p>When this happens, add the following effects based on the result of the Wind Die:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bend:</strong> Add 1 to the result of every other weaving die before interpreting the results. <em>(No die can be increased above 6.)</em></li>
<li><strong>Weave:</strong> If all of your dice in this action have a result of 3 or lower, your action succeeds.</li>
<li><strong>Fray:</strong> For each weaving die that resulted in a Bend or Weave effect, interpret that weaving’s effect as Fray instead.</li>
<li><strong>Tear:</strong> Change the results of each of your dice to 6 before determining success, critical success, consequences, and the effects of weaving.</li>

            <h1>Rain</h1>
            <p>A herald of the spring, rain visits us all letting nearby nature know renewal is just around the bend. Quiet taps on the roof of a home. The sound of droplets on leaves. The smell of wet earth and nearby flowers. The promise of new life to follow. Too much, and what once nourished life overflows to destroy it. Rivers break their bounds and people can find themselves in grave danger at a moment’s notice.</p>

You don’t make friends, you don’t hug, you <em>definitely</em> don’t trust people. You’ve developed a set of rules for survival that you can name and number at a moment’s notice, and if they sound overly specific to your current situation it’s <em>because you’ve been in this exact situation before</em>.</p>
<p>You don’t like these people. You don’t know why you still stick with them. You swear, tomorrow you’ll be gone. Really. This time you mean it.</p>

            <h1>Bone</h1>
            <p>Holding the Bone Die brings a deep sense of purpose. Hold it too long, however, and whispers of all that you are will come rising up to the surface, unearthing what you have buried for too long.</p>
<p>All creatures in Mnemonic are sums of their parts, held together by the trappings of their forms - all of which is wrapped around their bones, that which determines their shapes. We are but repositories for memories and experiences. They leave their mark upon us, whether we are aware of it or not. While the mind, heart and blood may forget, the bones will always remember.</p>
<p>Rattling the Bone Die means shaking sleeping or forgotten memories awake. It draws upon the scars that life leaves upon mortals, allowing the strength hidden within them to fill them once again. It can also reach beyond death, revealing secrets that could be equal parts terrible as they are beautiful, and telling stories that perhaps no one else can.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you weave with bones, consider the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>What was the last thing that the world forced you to bury deep within your heart? How does this memory give you the power to weave with bones?</li>
<li>What lost things are you seeking? Are you even aware of what you have lost to begin with?</li>

            <p>The Green Die is a die of renewal, harboring both the cold of deep dirts and the warmth of new life. It is an emissary for life on all scales, and demands the cycle of the world continue - offering the desperate a secure place in that cycle so long as they carry that burden…</p>
<p>When you hold the Green Die in your hands, you feel the pulsing of life around you and the pulls of their struggles (including your own). As it bounces in your hands, you observe the breaths of a thousand lifeforms as if they were resting on your shoulders. When the die is thrown, the breathing grows more and more intense, suddenly stopping when the die comes to a rest.</p>
<blockquote>

            <h1>Weaving Dice</h1>
            <p>The Weaver’s Dice are a special set of dice that a weaver keeps safe, separate from their other play materials. Some weavers keep these dice in individually housed containers, ready to produce at a moment’s notice. Others keep them together in a bag. There’s no one right way to store your Weaver’s Dice.</p>
<p>The entries in this chapter describe thirteen of the most common dice in the world of Mnemonic. If none of them fit your specific needs, you can develop your own using the template provided.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Each dice entry comes with a description of the physical die, but don’t feel obligated to seek out and purchase a die that matches the specific description. You should try to roll dice that feel comfortable to you, or that fit the feeling of what you’re rolling them for. If a die doesn’t feel right, find one that does.</p>

            <h1>Dragon&#39;s Husk</h1>
            <p>Not every dragon was wiped out of existence in the same moment; there were plenty of the foul creatures who were slain in combat, their corpses falling to land heavily in forests, marshes, the ocean. Over the many years since their death, the largest of their husks remains a feature in the landscape, its hollow corpse having developed a thriving natural ecosystem for plants, animals, and other forms of life.</p>
<p>Yet the world has a hard time letting these monsters go, and echoes wander about the place, of warriors who were eaten, or torn apart, by the dragon’s fury. Some of them are friendly. Others know only anger at an existence that will never end.</p>

<p>Dragons were initially imagined as allegories of empire. If you, like me, are descended from those who pursued empire, or are currently a beneficiary of empire yourself, I encourage you to be careful of how your stories rationalize or glorify the actions of conquering forces.</p>

<p>We meet our circle of weavers in a village nearby. It’s a place where travelers stop to rest before making the arduous detours necessary to avoid stepping too close to the Husk. In our sleep, we are all tormented by tempting whispers: riches, power, secrets.</p>
<h3 id="scene-play" tabindex="-1">Scene Play</h3>
<p>Something draws us near the Husk: a promise of answers to questions, or a request to retrieve an heirloom that was lost long ago.</p>
<h3 id="deck-burner" tabindex="-1">Deck Burner</h3>
<p>At the heart of the dragon’s corpse, an echo lingers of the dragon themself, desperately searching, hunting, for a way to restore their body to life. Their will presses into the surrounding landscape, creating dangerous echoes and other hazards that stand in the way of any who might seek to quiet the dragon’s endless whispers.</p>
<h3 id="laid-to-rest" tabindex="-1">Laid to Rest</h3>
<p>With the dragon defeated—or not—we return to the town with news of our success or failure. At night, we spend time in reflection, mourning our losses, and looking to the future.</p>

        
            <h1>Cawdor</h1>
            <p>Atop the hill rests the crown of the Sky District, where those with wealth and power congregate and rule. Within that lies its jewel, the Heaven District, where all manner of arcanists seek untold secrets. They are not Weavers; their art is a different beast. Make no mistake: these are the rulers of the city of Cawdor. Their words and desires are as laws.</p>
<p>Beneath halls of power, the Ocean District grows further along the shore with every season, thriving on the bounty of the fickle seas: fishing and trade with neighbors up and down the coast. Braver captains cross the deeper waters to and from lands unknown beyond the Grey, cutting through the fog of broken memory.</p>
<p>On the inland side, the Mountain District’s forges and workshops roar by day and night alike. The river cutting through it powers water mills, a final gift from the water before it rejoins Cawdor’s violent, storm-wracked seas. They make tools, and they make toys, and all too often they make weapons.</p>
<p>Further still are the unofficial districts. One is the Forest District, a rainforest that grows heartier with each year since the end of the time of dragons under the tender care of Weavers and woodsfolk. The next is the Plains District, a sprawl of small family farms that provide vegetables and fruit to the city.</p>
<p>The final is the Swamp District, the city’s unacknowledged shame, a slum in the shadow of the Sky and Heaven Districts, drenched in the runoff from their arcane experiments.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you tell a story that includes Cawdor, consider the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Who exactly is the ruling class of the Sky District? How do they maintain their authority?</li>
<li>How do the discoveries of the Heaven District arcanists make the lives of the people better? Your lives?</li>
<li>What damage did the forest suffer under the dominion of dragons? What did they hope to gain?</li>
<li>What are the worst symptoms of the Swamp District’s contamination?</li>

<p>The story of Cawdor is the story of power and its price. We see the marvels of the Heaven District and confront a danger far greater than any external threat: the hidden costs of our bread and circuses.</p>
<h3 id="first-gathering" tabindex="-1">First Gathering</h3>
<p>A plague, the physicians tell us, is taking the city. It started, they will admit only grudgingly, in the Swamp District—where it was totally ignored until it began to reach the wealthier districts. The people demand official action. The finest minds of the Heaven District have no answer, so the Sky District calls upon an older tradition, potent but outside of their control: Weavers.</p>
<h3 id="free-%5B%5Bscene%3F%5D%5D-play" tabindex="-1">Free [[Scene?]] Play</h3>
<p>We seek the root of the disease, its origin, with an official mandate. We follow the stories of those harmed by it. We find the commonalities among those who are officially the worst affected, laborers in Mountain District workshops and in Heaven District laboratories. We go to those who are in truth suffering most: the pollutant-bathed untouchables in the Swamp District. We ask questions of Heavenly arcanists that they might not enjoy.
###Deck Burner
The truth is undeniable: this is not a plague. This is contamination. Many substances used in the miracles of Heaven District alchemy are toxic with extended exposure, and the arcanists knew it. This cannot go on. Whether we turn Sky and Heaven against each other by evidence of their malfeasance or we reveal the truth to the people of the city and leave things in their hands, the Heavenly arcanists will cling to power until it is taken from them.</p>
<h3 id="laid-to-rest" tabindex="-1">Laid to Rest</h3>
<p>Perhaps justice has been done. Perhaps not. Perhaps it was not our place to decide, whether or not we had the power to. Regardless, the part we played is over; it’s time to move on. What costs were paid by the city, and what costs are still yet to be paid? How will their lives change? What will become of the Heaven District’s elites, who named the suffering of others a fair price for their eminence?</p>

        
            <h1>The Goldenbloom</h1>
            <p>Dusk, dawn, or high noon, the ship gleamed rays of god to pierce even the thickest clouds that stood in its way. The Goldenbloom is more than just a vessel, it’s a way of life, your life.</p>
<p>The marvel flew the skies for generations, how many not even the dozens of your predecessors could tell. Through centuries and lifetimes, it’s seen all the world could offer, it’s flown through sleet, sun, rust, and rot. Maybe even shedding its hull for a new skin every so often, at least, that’s what its walls tell you.</p>
<p>As the tide of generations turn, you take the helm of the vessel, to go wherever you want to do whatever you want. Because at the end of the day, and the start of the next, when the sun hits the hull, it’ll bloom with golden opportunity.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Before you set sail to soar the clouds, consider the following:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>How did the airship come into your hands? Was there a previous captain before you?</li>
<li>How was it when it was handed to you? What did it look like? Did you change anything at all?</li>
<li>Is the Goldenbloom a one-of-a-kind warship armed with cannons? Or a cargo vessel that could fit whole houses?</li>
<li>Is this ship home to a crew of pirates or sailors? Or do you ride the clouds as a lone wanderer?</li>

<p>First we swam, then we walked, and now we fly. When the islands first raised up into the air and the ground fell into itself, we adapted. Most saw the calamity as a damnation, remnants of civilisation punished to be torn apart from one another. To others, a gift, being brought closer to the stars, to the gods, to the heavenly bodies that were always out of our reach.</p>
<h3 id="first-gathering" tabindex="-1">First Gathering</h3>
<p>Those that hadn’t settled on the islands made their homes in airships, and a delicate dynamic between the two was born— skyfarers became a necessity and islanders their hubs and ports. This was the new order of things, one needing the other, lest everything fall apart and become lost to time.</p>
<h3 id="scene-play" tabindex="-1">Scene Play</h3>
<p>Though the crescendo of the calamity that was had passed, it never truly ceased, shifts in the islands and clouds, seen or unseen, took their forms and came and went. With this new world came a new frontier, one that could be explored, expedited, and exploited to hearts’ content.</p>
<h3 id="deck-burner" tabindex="-1">Deck Burner</h3>
<p>For the creative and adventurous, even witnessing these ephemeral etherealities was a priceless godsend. Artisans, scholars, even thrill seekers all sought their share of the new world and bygones of the old, the only problem is finding a willing skyfarer to take them there.</p>
<h3 id="laid-to-rest" tabindex="-1">Laid to Rest</h3>
<p>With each journey made, a course is set, a flight flown, and a deed well done. So long as the Goldenbloom and its captain sees the light of day and dusk of night, all is well, the only thing that matters is where else there’s to go.</p>

        
            <h1>The Mnemonic Setting</h1>
            <p>Mnemonic is an anti-canon setting, which means that everything we present is meant to be revised and personalized to fit the needs of the story you’re telling. If you have strong associations with the color green, for instance, you might make it a feature of your story that when someone weaves a memory, the world around them takes on a green tinge.</p>
<p>You can embrace the anti-canon nature of the setting as a facet of your worldbuilding, or use it as license to change things as you need to. That being said, there are some things that are important to us as writers that, if you do change certain things, you at least know their importance.</p>
<p>The entries in this chapter describe places, people, events, or objects of interest that you might want to include in your worldbuilding. You don’t need to use all of them, and you don’t need to use them as presented. Some entries come with questions to guide your storytelling. Some include sample story arcs to provide you with a ready-made structure for playing games with the session frameworks in this book. <em>(Some entries might even contradict other entries. The setting is anti-canon even within itself.)</em></p>
<p>For storytellers who want to flesh out the world in similar ways, we’ve also provided a template that you can use to write your own anti-canon setting entries.</p>
<p>Take what you need. Change what doesn’t fit. Discard the rest. Enjoy your journey through the world of memory.</p>

            <h1>Capital City</h1>
            <p>One day someone showed up in expensive-looking clothes. They called themselves a Capitalist. They told us that there was a place nearby called Capital City, where anyone could go to find their fortune. They told us that a fortune was a thing to be coveted.</p>
<p>Capital City is protected by spells that keep it hidden from the world. It has to be that way, the Capitalist said, to make sure it doesn’t get found by those who would ruin it for everybody. But for those who are ready to find their fortune, all they have to do is bring their wares into the city. The invisible market will take care of the rest. That was what the Capitalist said.</p>
<p>Those who return from the city told stories of grandeur and opulence, of enormous wealth and fortune. They will say that <em>anyone</em> can go there and find success, if they just try hard enough.</p>
<p>But not everyone returns. And no one can tell us what happens to those who are still inside that invisible city, wandering the market, looking for an open place to set up their stall, waiting for customers who never appear.</p>
<p>The ones who return can’t tell us how it was decided who got to find their fortune, and who was doomed to struggle and fail. They can’t tell us where their customers came from, or where they went when they left. They seem unable to remember. “It’s the invisible market!” they say. “That’s the magic of it.”</p>
<p>Capital City is a wondrous place, the Capitalists say. And for the people who are chosen for success, it probably is. But for everyone else, it seems to be a dungeon from which there is no escape.</p>

<p>If you tell a story about the Invisible Market, here are some things you should know:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Invisible Market is not your friend. It’s not anyone’s friend.</li>

<li>The Invisible Market is always hungry.</li>
<li>The rest of the world has survived without the Invisible Market.</li>

            <h1>Ironhold</h1>
            <p>Rocks jutting forth from the earth are the first signs of any traveler to know that they’re close to the city of Ironhold, the huge, sprawling city of the Stoneborn. Those that have been here before would know better than to fight the jagged cliffs and the sharp edges of earth here. There is no other way but to weave with the land as you go. This valley, bordered by the Mountains of Cornelion and the Sapphire Cliffs, used to be a wide expanse of flats and plains, until Fomalhault came.</p>
<p>Ironhold is a city filled to the brim with magic, beating in time to a comet’s heart. It isn’t hard to spot the massive crater that makes up the very center of Ironhold: Fomalhaut’s Maw. Eons ago, a behemoth of a comet decided to come down and make the land its home. The comet’s descent rippled through the terrain, hence the irregular terrain that, today, has become commonplace. The very walls of Ironhold are built on these irregularities, glowing and pulsing, as if it were breathing. The rocks reach for the skies, gazing upon Fomalhault’s old home.</p>
<p>Ironhold’s folk are stalwart when it comes to their hospitality. Many believe that perpetuating hospitality and prosperity help keep alive the Heart of Fomalhault, a living meteorite shard of ice and stone enshrined in a Tower at the center of the Fomalhault’s Maw. The Stoneborn believe that this Heart is what keeps them and the land alive. Fomalhault, in their love for the beauty of this world chose to come down from the heavens to lend their vitality to the land - at least, that’s what the Stoneborn will tell you.</p>
<p>The magicks of Ironhold are felt the moment you enter the gates - gems, glowing according to their kind, are on nearly every other lamp post, paved walkway, gate and door. They glow in time to each other and in time to the Heart of Fomalhault. Gems extracted from the nearby mountains are mined and blessed once every month by the Hands of Fomalhault, masked Stoneborn who have chosen to bathe in the pools that surround the Tower within the Maw. They serve as conduits to the Heart and its power. The blessed gems are then distributed to every home and organization. If you were to visit during the colder months, the gems emit this lovely warmth that keep the people of this city. They’re used as sources of power for most anything and everything - electricity, spell and ritual components, and much more.</p>
<p>Ironhold is home to some of the world’s most skilled astrologers and weather scholars. Within Fomalhault’s Tower are the three main fonts of knowledge in Ironhold: the Olivine Basilica, The Maelstrom Observatory, and the Studium of the Clouds.</p>
<p>The Olivine Basilica is a school for those interested in studying the stars. Of interest, their best scholars monitor the heavens for the famed lover of Fomalhault, Antares. The Stoneborn believe that the reason why Fomalhault landed in our world is because they were flying towards Antares, their lover, who lives on the other side of the sky. The Legend goes that  Antares had told Fomalhault, “search for the brightest light in the sky, I’ll keep it burning for you.” During their flight, however, they had become mesmerized by our world’s light, thinking this was where Antares was. Alas, during their descent, only the Heart remained. So, today, the astrologers of the Tower watch the skies for Antares, as they believe that one day the brightest star will come to claim the heart of their lover. When that time comes, the Stoneborn are well aware that they will lose their city’s main source of power, vitality and prosperity. While they have no intention to retaliate against Fomalhault’s lover, they want to be prepared.</p>
<p>The Maelstrom Observatory is an order of knight-sailors that watch the skies for any storms that often blow in from the Sapphire Cliffs. When one does come, they ride off into the eye of it in their skyships to battle with it and calm it down before it brings forth any terrible damage to Ironhold. They bottle lightning in glass jars, specially crafted to contain that much power which the city can eventually use as an alternative energy source. Then, they pierce the eye of the storm so that it dissipates peacefully before it can wreak any more havoc. The knight-sailors of the Observatory train intensively for years before they are even allowed to sail. It is a responsibility fraught with danger.</p>
<p>The Studium of the Clouds is another school that teaches their students how to study the clouds and weave their magic to call forth rain whenever the droughts come. Their magic also helps move the clouds over to the reservoirs where the clouds are either drained of their water or magically stored in case the city needs to craft a storm to farm lightning.</p>

        
            <h1>The Glittering Graveyard</h1>
            <p>Search into the places that no one goes and you will find them. Twisted metal superstructures peeking out of forgotten earth, like bones of something long dead. The buildings themselves are half swallowed by the ground they stand in, multiple levels of blinking light and groaning floors burrowing deep, with artifacts of life sprinkled in between.</p>
<p>The largest of these places is called the Glittering Graveyard, brass and blue towers drowned by desert sand. There is no memory of this place, or at least none that people share, but pain can be felt whenever one draws near. There is an ache in this place, and though it yearns to be heard, it is the ache that keeps those who would listen away.</p>

<p>Eventually, you find the perpetrator, a solemn look on their face. They tell you they cannot forget-- not like the others. What means did you have to take to make them divulge? What truths did they reveal to you that you were not ready for? Moving forward, you now saddle a new burden from this knowledge.</p>

        
            <h1>The Unforgotten City</h1>
            <p>Among the wonders of the world are its cities. Each with its own stories and legends with people that create new ones all the time. While some cities are remembered for their events, others cities are sentient and remember things of their own while enjoying the new memories that their citizens make.</p>
<p>However, as sentient beings often do, some cities feel discontent or sorrow with what they remember. Others feel anxious about things like war, or not providing enough for their residents, or that they might be forgotten. Occasionally, some cities move to do things to prevent these things and protect their people and themselves.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>When you tell this story of the unforgotten city, consider the following:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>What do you remember about the unforgotten city?</li>
<li>What is the unforgotten city called where you come from?</li>
<li>How do you honor the city when you tell this story?</li>
<li>What does this story teach you about letting go?</li>

<h2 id="story-arc%3A-of-fear-and-forgetting" tabindex="-1">Story Arc: Of Fear and Forgetting</h2>
<p>In this story, we visit a city known by many names to many people, but known to everyone as the Unforgotten City where we imagine ourselves as people who are new to the city. We walk the streets seeing what marvels and memories the city holds and learn a concerning truth.</p>
<h3 id="first-gathering" tabindex="-1">First Gathering</h3>
<p>You gather at a well-lit town square where people are dressed in various costumes. Streamers and lights decorate the streets and buildings as far as the eye can see and you can feel joy from every brick and cobblestone. You senses are filled with the smell of delicious foods and laughter. It is during this spectacle that you meet your first new friend, Martin of the Whimsical Whizzbang.</p>
<h3 id="into-the-grey" tabindex="-1">Into the Grey</h3>
<p>The next day, people are removing decorations from the previous night’s festivities. You run into Martin who seems a bit out of sorts. He expresses that he is having some difficulty returning to his home. The city is many things, but large is not one of them.</p>
<h3 id="deck-burner" tabindex="-1">Deck Burner</h3>
<p>As you talk to Martin and try to help him find his way home, you find yourself unable to leave the city. Paths you take twists and  turn unexpectedly, all leading back into the city. You decide to ask the city for help, but it refuses to assist. What is the city not telling you?</p>
<h3 id="laid-to-rest" tabindex="-1">Laid to Rest</h3>
<p>It is a day’s journey outside of the city and Martin has long since gone home. Most of the residents continued on as normal, but you find yourself thinking about the city and how it will treat others who wish to leave it. You hope it will remember what you’ve shared.</p>

        
            <h1>The Children of An and Enki</h1>
            <p>It was long ago, in a time before time, that Enki the Earth and An the Sky glimpsed each other. Both infinite in their power and majesty, it was their antipodal differences that first drew them to each other, though those differences initially shocked and repulsed - so much so, that shortly after that fateful first glance Earth and Sky warred for six days and seven nights in that timeless, primordial chaos. Upon the seventh day their warlike embrace became a loving one, and the union of Earth and Sky produced children that were not entirely of one world or the other, but who stood upon both.</p>
<p>Enki and An’s love was not to last; for soon Enki began to look past An and into the stars, and An’s gaze began to drift from Enki to stare upon their own reflection in the vast, wide sea. Their estrangement tore the Earth and the Sky apart forever, and left both populated with the Children of An and Enki; those in between, the liminal folk, who freely walk between Earth and Sky and yet belong to neither.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As you stand upon the Earth and gaze up into the Sky, ask yourself:</p>
<ul>
<li>What do the Children look like? How do they resemble both Earth and Sky? What sets them apart from their parents?</li>
<li>As forgotten children, in what way do they seek the favor of their wayward parents?</li>
<li>Enki and An refuse to involve their Children in their struggles. Why?</li>
<li>What good omens do the Children of An and Enki bring upon others?</li>

<h2 id="the-grand-conjunction" tabindex="-1">The Grand Conjunction</h2>
<p>Every year at the appointed time, the Sun and Moon and Stars align in such a way that casts Earth and Sky in glorious illumination. A Grand Conjunction, a gathering beneath a great eclipse, where time loses power and distance loses meaning for a single night. On this night of nights, the Children of An and Enki return from their travels across time and space to share amongst themselves and others stories of strange vistas and mysterious wonders they have encountered on their travels.</p>
<h3 id="first-gathering" tabindex="-1">First Gathering</h3>
<p>You have joined the Grand Conjunction, to share and revel and learn at the feet of these Children of Earth and Sky. How does the ground ripple beneath their feet? How does the air charge and crackle with their voices? How have you come to catch the eyes of the Children?</p>
<h3 id="free-play" tabindex="-1">Free Play</h3>
<p>The revelry begins. Great bonfires are sparked, offerings burned, and the food and drink and good cheer are free-flowing. What tales of courage and skill are told among the People? What feats of witchcraft and skill are displayed by the Children?</p>
<h3 id="deck-burner" tabindex="-1">Deck Burner</h3>
<p>The Conjunction reaches a fevered pitch: laughter turns to bloodshed turns to lovemaking, deeds exaggerated through story are proved in the moment, gifts are given and tribute offered. How do you prove your worth to the Children? How do the Children’s wild revelries give you pause? If you are called to walk the Longest Road, will you leave your home?</p>
<h3 id="laid-to-rest" tabindex="-1">Laid to Rest</h3>
<p>Sun and Moon have drifted, the stars are no longer in alignment, and the Children depart in shimmering beams of aurora-like light. Who remains among the smouldering campfires? What signs of their passing have the Children left? Who has been Chosen to join the Children, to take their place among them in the stars, where such revels need never end?</p>

        
            <h1>The Wide Sea &amp; The Keeper</h1>
            <p>The brilliant blue of the Wide Sea can only be rivalled by the sky above it. The stunning sea-green, the sea foam crashing against the shore, the impeccable deep - all alluring and ever unwilling to let you out of its grasp. There is much to be found in the Wide Sea if you only learn to swim within its waves.</p>
<p>Stories about the Sea are as abundant as the treasures that lay beneath it. Have you ever had a wish you so desired to be granted? There’s a story about lost pearls and turtles that might enchant you.</p>
<p>Past the Viper Whorls and the Seaking’s Rest, where the seafoam turns gold by the light of the sun is Turtle’s Paradise, a mythical island inhabited by a young sea godling known as the Keeper of Turtles. It is said that they wear this beautiful necklace, with iridescent pearls that can control the tides. Tragedy ensues when the godling loses the necklace to the very waves she watches over. Feeling her grief, the turtles that she so loved set forth into the world to find the pearls.</p>
<p>The turles, massive as they were, overturned every sea rock and boulder and even dug into the seabed as they wanted, trying hard to find the lost pearls. This caused the earth to split and shift, giving birth to some of the isles that we know of today. Alas, despite their persistence, they could not find all the pearls.</p>
<p>This is why I asked you if you wish to have your wish granted because the godling grants the wishes of whoever finds those pearls. Would you dare take the plunge? How deep would you go for your precious wish?</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="heist-on-the-seas" tabindex="-1">Heist on the Seas</h2>
<p>One of the Keeper’s pearls is rumored to have been found by the famous Featherbane Auction House that holds their exclusive auctions while cruising around Blue Jay Bay. What’s more, the  notorious warmachine monger Halzen Lockheart has his eyes on the pearls. You, however, have other plans for the pearl.</p>
<h3 id="first-gathering" tabindex="-1">First Gathering</h3>
<p>Everyone has heard the story. The Keeper’s pearls are legendary and wish-granting. You could either have your wildest dreams within your grasp or sell it to the highest bidder, but for you, anyone’s hands are better than Halzen Lockheart’s. Talk about why this is so for your character.</p>
<h3 id="scene-play" tabindex="-1">Scene Play</h3>
<p>The story begins with a brief flashback to your crew coming together to talk about how the heist is supposed to go. As soon as that’s settled, you play through your plans to get on this exclusive auction and somehow win the prize before Lockheart can get his hands on it. The night begins with a lights show just as the food gets rolled into the auction hall.</p>
<h3 id="deck-burner" tabindex="-1">Deck Burner</h3>
<p>The first point of conflict begins with securing access to the auction - meaning a ride on Featherbane SS, the ship where the auction will go down. Next, acquiring the pearl. Will you steal it away before the auction begins, amidst all these affluent people? Or will you risk attempting to win against the staggering bids?</p>
<h3 id="laid-to-rest" tabindex="-1">Laid to Rest</h3>
<p>What have we lost today? Who or what have we given up for the Pearl and for our dreams? Did it seem worth it all in the end?</p>

            <h1>Where The Rivers Embrace</h1>
            <p>Twin tributaries of shimmering crystal, blue veins feeding and fed by the pulsing heart of a salt sea, running parallel for countless miles before becoming locked in tumultuous embrace, just before disappearing into the wild blue. The Twin Rivers, they of too many names to name, define these lands, the fertile delta of this alluvial plain; flooded grassland and scorched savannah and salt marsh.</p>
<p>The Marsh People live amongst the birds and the fish and the water buffalo and the tall grasses, dwelling in secluded communities of elaborate reed houses; each home a vessel, each community a floatilla. They alone speak the language of wild rice, of reed-warbler and ibis, of water-buffalo and her fierce wife, crocodile. They alone remember how gazelle fooled death by standing still as a reed; how elephant trampled lion’s cub and, though she knew, slew nine antelope instead. They alone remember when mortals were shaped from clay, when the whispers of Gods riffled through the reeds, and when the accord between those who dwell in the great cities of sandstone and clay and those spirits who dwell within the wild, wild forests of cedar was first consummated in blood on the banks of the Twin Rivers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Old Angler grins at you with eyes that are not quite that of a bird; stilt-like legs barely stirring the waters as they stride, the tall reeds nigh undisturbed by their passing. A flash of spear, or beak; silver scales in the moonlight, three perfect drops of blood.</p>
<ul>
<li>What has drawn you back to the land of these Marsh People? Why now, at the eve of the annual consummation of the accord between city and the wilds?</li>
<li>What do you see within the Angler’s eyes? What do you see within the drops of swirling blood in the water? What do you see in the scales of the fish, reflected in the moonlight?</li>
<li>What threats to the sanctity of the accord give you pause? How has it been maintained after all these long years?</li>
<li>How do the wilds respect the boundaries of the city? How does the city respect the boundaries of the wilds?</li>

<p>Once a year, in honor of the ancient accord between the city and the wilds, a priestess from the city and a wildling from the cedar forest re-enact that first and portentous meeting from that halcyon time of Gods and Monsters; when the wise Shamhat spent six days and seven nights in the embrace of Enkidu, shaped-from-clay to rival the greatest warlord the People had ever known.
This year, like every year, the ritual must take place to celebrate and secure the peace between the sunbaked clay streets and the hard-packed steppe flats. This year, like every year, that hard-won peace balances upon the edge of a knife.</p>
<h3 id="first-gathering" tabindex="-1">First Gathering</h3>
<p>The priestess awaits in the temple, as is tradition, garbed in silk and samite and fine jewels. And, as is tradition, would-be guardians await without, boasting of their exploits in hopes that they will be the one chosen. Of the glimpse gleaned of the priestess: in what way are they elegant and worldly? In what way are they naive? In what way do you stand out among the other would-be guardians?</p>
<h3 id="free-play" tabindex="-1">Free Play</h3>
<p>The wilds outside of the city are perilous for the unwary. What powers natural and unnatural stand in the way? In what way is the journey made easier in an unexpected manner?</p>
<p>The priestess has prepared for this moment their entire life. How does that training and preparation, in turn, teach and guide the guardians?</p>
<h3 id="deck-burner" tabindex="-1">Deck Burner</h3>
<p>Upon opposite banks of the Twin Rivers the priestess and the wildling are destined to glimpse each other, as their forebearers did in that misty time before time. What preparations need be made before that monumental first glance might be taken? What forces stand in opposition to the peace of this accord?</p>
<h3 id="laid-to-rest" tabindex="-1">Laid to Rest</h3>
<p>Only the first glance is destined. What follows lies in the heart of the wildling and the priestess: do they cross the river to meet, or turn away? Do they ignore their destinies, or embrace them? Do the guardians allow fate to play its part, or ensure the accord is maintained for another year?
No matter the outcome, the thread that has been woven this night can never be unthreaded.</p>

            <p>As it crawled its way up the horizon it consumed everything and anything, every shape of color, every ray of light, and every corner of the eye.</p>
<p>It didn’t matter where you were, only that someone else had been there, that they had enough reason to come back, and they always would. The storm was their vessel, except it brought them back a little less than alive, a little more than dead, but still not quite in between.</p>
<p>Contrary to cliché, the inhabitants of the storm had no inherent malevolence, nor are they god-fearing by any means. No, these souls did in death as they did in life, this much is known to those who crossed the storm’s path on regular occasions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>As you take in the storm’s air into your breath, consider the following:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Is this your first encounter with the Requiem? If not, is it by coincidence or with purpose?</li>
<li>What do the winds blow with it? Just people? Pets, maybe? Plants, even?</li>
<li>How does your world treat its citizens of the past? With glee? Contempt? Indifference? Or a combination of the above?</li>

<p>Muck and mud and steel and wood and blood and bones— the definitions of war, the spillages made in pursuit of ideals. We’re told the death with resolve is the only one that matters, that such a thing can only be gained on a battlefield. Yet always omitting the bodies snapped in twain, the minds infested with itches, the souls stretched and malformed, incrementally, day after bloody day.</p>
<h3 id="first-gathering" tabindex="-1">First Gathering</h3>
<p>It’s been long past those years where soldiers sat in trenches and foxholes, but the silence of stalemate stays, as do the cracks of gunshots that eventually break them. With the storm came those once was, and with them came the world they once lived.</p>
<h3 id="scene-play" tabindex="-1">Scene Play</h3>
<p>Though the chaos of the wars that were stayed in their graves, their victims were dug out of theirs. With each passing one came their own struggles, their own traumas, somehow entirely different yet perfectly identical from the last and the next.

<h3 id="deck-burner" tabindex="-1">Deck Burner</h3>
<p>With whatever bit of time the storm lends them, they cried. Not with words, not with voice, not even in tears. Their cries echo in the soul, turning into a pain that cripples mind and body. If only there was someone to reach their hands out or lend an ear to them.</p>
<h3 id="laid-to-rest" tabindex="-1">Laid to Rest</h3>
<p>Action or inaction, the storm will pass as it came, that much is set in stone. One can only hope these saddened souls found their peace during their stay, that they returned with new eyes and whole hearts. For it’s the fate of all to join it one day.</p>

            <h1>How The Spider Learned To Weave Magic</h1>
            <p>There was once a lone spider who was only as large as a chestnut. She was small, but she was crafty, and with skill she wove webs in order to trap her prey. On the first night of the full moon she saw a figure on two legs, that glowed like a sun, stumbling his way towards her. Quickly she spun a web of threads as thin as a moonbeam, placed directly in the figure’s path. Not minding where he was going the figure stepped directly into it, becoming trapped in the shimmering threads.</p>
<p>“Unhand me!” said the god, for what other manner of being would walk defenselessly at such a time?</p>
<p>“I will not,” said the spider, “Unless you grant my request.”</p>
<p>The god cursed and pleaded, transforming into a thousand myriad forms, but the spider’s webs were true and held fast. Finally he relented, returning to his first form. “Very well then, little one. What is it you wish?”</p>
<p>“Make me bigger, for I do not want to be squashed underfoot. Make it so that I can see others eye to eye, and that we are as equals.”</p>
<p>The god thought on this request as he looked at the spider’s expression. She had been earnest and clever, and it was not every day that he could meet a creature who could trap a god. So he looked into his mind, at the worlds that once was and the worlds that would be, and wove into existence a new body that she could inhabit.</p>
<p>Closing her eyes, the spider travelled beyond her little body into the new one created by the god. When she reopened them, she felt the heft and weight of each new leg, gingerly stepping onto the ground and hearing the thud . At first, she was delighted, until she realized her request was only half complete.</p>
<p>“The job is not finished, o shimmering one.”</p>
<p>“And why is that?” asked the god.</p>
<p>“Because I am not equal yet. After all, I am only myself but larger. But you are able to conjure up such wondrous things. Am I still not inferior to yourself, or the other creatures around me?”</p>
<p>At this the god laughed with delight, and pointed at the spider’s web. “No, my dear, you are above them. Look at what you created, when you were but a small creature with only your wits and your silk to sustain you. All you must do is harness that which you knew, and imbue that knowledge into that which you create.”</p>
<p>So the spider looked into herself, and remembered. From her body she produced the silk that was hers, tempered with the strength of those who had preyed upon her and the speed of those who wished her ill.  With precision and gentleness, like a mother knitting for her newborn, she created for herself a companion. The same eight legs, the same six eyes, and a smile that melted her heart. And so, the second spider was born.</p>

        
            <h1>Ritual of Atonement</h1>
            <p>There are two violations against the community for which we initiate this ritual: murder and… a violation of person such that the person is murdered, yet left alive. We do not speak of it casually.</p>
<p>The ritual always involves everyone; we are beholden one to another. In the event of a murder, the murderer is brought to the circle along with the relatives of the murdered. All of them.</p>
<p><strong>So do you…?</strong></p>
<p>What?</p>
<p><strong>You know… have a trial or execute them or…</strong></p>
<p>Ah. No. We do not. We have no need for this.</p>
<p><strong>What… do you mean?</strong></p>
<p>The circle is activated and there, all must consent to the ritual. Once done, all within the circle share their grief with the murderer. The community grieves with them. The murderer has one of two things happen: they see a vision and receive a mission or…</p>
<p><strong>… they are exiled?</strong></p>
<p>What is exile?</p>
<p><strong>It is when you send someone away from their people or something and tell them they will die if they come back.</strong></p>
<p>You come from a place where death or entrapment is constant, I take it.</p>
<p><strong>… when you put it that way, yes.</strong></p>
<p>We do not do that here. The ritual is not to judge who should live or die.</p>
<p><strong>So then… what happens?</strong></p>
<p>As I was saying, the repentant open themselves to the grief of the community. If their hearts are true, a guardian will appear to them and guide them to atonement. The community disappears until they have done what the guide requires. If they are not, then they age according to the grief they cause and they receive the cruelest of judgments.</p>
<p><strong>…death?</strong></p>
<p>No. Isolation.</p>
<p><strong>Like jail… erm, entrapment?</strong></p>
<p>No. Rather, the people of this community and all of their kin disappear from them… forever. They are unable to cause harm to anyone else here and likely not to anyone else. The grief never leaves them.</p>
<p><strong>What about… the other thing that wasn’t named.</strong></p>
<p>In that case, the people involved are brought to the circle and share their grief. Those who know of the violation have been known to cry out from the grief. For those who were aware and did nothing, they and the violator are aged relative to their grief. This community and all of their kin disappear from this person’s vision forever.</p>
<p><strong>Is there… no atonement?</strong></p>
<p>No. A life can accidentally be taken. Violations of this order cannot be accidentally done. There is no atonement for the latter.</p>
<p><strong>None, ever? What if….</strong></p>
<p>How would you undo such a violation? By what means would you restore that to a person?</p>
<p><strong>…ah. Well has anyone ever lied?</strong></p>
<p>Some have tried. It has not gone well for them.</p>
<p><strong>What do you mean?</strong></p>
<p>I’ve only witnessed this once in my lifetime and even that recollection is fuzzy. Where some people weren’t able to find their way back, these people… those who would lie… I struggle to remember them clearly. The circle, rather than taking them away from us, takes us away from each other.</p>
<p><strong>You mean…</strong></p>
<p>Yes. No one quite remembers them.</p>

<p>Someone obviously took extreme care to write this recipe down in such haste. You’re not quite sure why the recipe is important, but seeing the handwriting makes you think it’s important. The recipe has three sections which are clear though: Creation, Disaster, and Anachrony.</p>
<h2 id="creation" tabindex="-1">Creation</h2>
<p>To make the recipe, you must find the following ingredients. Each time you read the recipe, the words seem to be ever-changing. Yet somehow, it still feels like the same recipe.</p>
<p>To complete the Creation, choose a word or phrase using the prompts in the parentheses. Each party member should fill in at least one blank.</p>
<ul>
<li>______ stalks of _____ (Number, verb)</li>
<li>Eighteen ____ bunches of ______ (adjective, noun)</li>
<li>A dash of _____ (verb) from the ____ (terrain)</li>
<li>One vial of _____ (an emotion you recently felt that you would like to forget)</li>
<li>Two springs of ____ herbs (an emotion you wish to feel again but haven’t felt recently)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="disaster" tabindex="-1">Disaster</h2>
<p>To complete the Disaster, complete the following steps and choose a word or phrase using the prompts in the parentheses. Each party member should fill in at least one blank.</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a fire using _____ instead of firewood (an echo that is still haunting your world).</li>
<li>Create a bundle by placing ingredients into a _____ and wrap up using ______ (an object that holds importance to someone in the party, a sad verb that evokes conflicting emotions).</li>
<li>Place the bundle onto the fire.</li>
<li>Sing a song out loud as you watch the fire envelop the bundle.
<ul>
<li>What mood does your song set? Do you feel a sense of loss, or do you feel relieved by letting go of these items?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Stir the fire using a ____ (something from your childhood that you don’t have in your possession).
<ul>
<li>What do you see? Is the fire burning the bundle?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sacrifice your ____ to the flames.</li>
</ol>
<p>You begin to feel a sense of loss.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“I am you. You are me. The fire has taken me in the past, yet I remain a part of this world. Will you set me free?”</em></p>
<p>…Who is this?..</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="anachrony" tabindex="-1">Anachrony</h2>
<p>As the fire dies out, you see the charred bundle amongst the coals. Inside the bundle, you see a meal. Describe what the meal looks like. As you eat your meal, consider the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>What impacts did you cause by collecting the ingredients?</li>
<li>Can you repay yourselves and the land for what you took?</li>
<li>Is the meal alive? Are you alive?</li>
<li>Have you now forgotten or remembered anything?</li>
</ol>

            <p>For eons, a rift or echo would appear, humming a haunting tune. Practiced weavers in particular hear a choir singing in harmonious clarity, and are known to be lured away from the world as a result.</p>

<pre><code>Weft undrawn and warp unstrung
Empty frames with threads unspun
Slivers of memory slip away
Splindly like mist that dissipate
Only a hollow calling for an echo remain

Gaze upon this loom undone
Scorched by flames, a past forgone
Within the ashes a voice raised
Speaking out to those unafraid
A thousand prophecies relayed in unison say:

            <h1>Morning Coffee</h1>
            <p>I don’t always have the energy to get out the big press and wait five minutes. I don’t have the devices to use paper filters, and my coffee is too coarse for that anyway.</p>
<p>What do I have? A mesh kitchen strainer, a liquid measuring cup, and a mug. So let’s make some coffee.</p>
<h2 id="making-a-cup-of-coffee-when-all-you-have-is-a-mesh-strainer%2C-a-liquid-measuring-cup%2C-and-a-mug" tabindex="-1">Making A Cup of Coffee When All You Have Is  A Mesh Strainer, A Liquid Measuring Cup, And A Mug</h2>
<p>First, make sure your coffee is ground coarse, as coarse as it would need to be for a coffee press. (If you get your coffee from a store, ask them to grind it “As coarse as you can make it”)</p>
<p>Boil some water.</p>
<p>While waiting for the water to boil, put two tablespoons of coffee grounds in the bottom of the liquid measuring cup.</p>
<p>Add half of one tablespoon of your favorite sweetener. I use maple syrup.</p>
<p>When the water is boiling, pour it into the measuring cup. I do this slowly because I like mixing the grounds into the coffee with the pouring. If you don’t do that, use the tablespoon to stir it gently until everything is mixed.</p>
<p>Place the mesh strainer in the top of your mug.</p>
<p>Slowly pour the coffee from the measuring cup through the mesh strainer. Do your best to pour it into the same spot, so that you end up with a tidy little mound of coffee grounds in the strainer.</p>
<p>Add milk if you like.</p>
<p>Enjoy.</p>

        
            <h1>Where Sand meets the Ocean</h1>
            <blockquote>
<p>An excerpt from Hues of the Harbor of Sound and Color: A Poetry Compilation, written by Hsien Lunyi.</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>The ocean waves lap at the feet of the harbor,
A steady pulse of a peace hard earned.

Its surface glows,
A crystalline blue, 
A mirror to your soul,
A window to when it was once 
                                            red.
Where the only sounds were 
Of clashing blades,
Of screams by those who are no longer 
with us,
Of regrets that cannot be undone

Where the only colors were
Of soot and ash,
Of crimson soaked rags,         
Of a time that does not belong
                                            in the colorful hues of 
                                                    a new dawn.

                                                    The ocean glows,
                                                    Pink, purple and gold, 
                                                    Without a trace of red.</code></pre>

        
            <h1>Making Dinner</h1>
            <p>A small industry evolved in the city of Luminaria over the making and selling of recipes.</p>
<p>But no one would pay full price for a scrap of paper containing just a list of ingredients; so the recipe artists began padding out their recipes with long stories about where the recipe came from, what was going through their head or their life when they developed it, how they hope the recipe will bring joy to one’s home.</p>
<p>And the stories were interesting to read, if you had the time to read them; but most people don’t have the time to read <em>about</em> a recipe when they’re trying to get dinner made and on the table before the kids start fussing.</p>
<p>What to do? If you knew that someone spent time telling you their story you would feel compelled to listen. A Weaver was consulted, and the following ritual created.</p>
<h2 id="following-a-recipe-where-it-also-contains-a-long-story-and-your-kids-are-hungry-and-impatient" tabindex="-1">Following A Recipe Where It Also Contains A Long Story And Your Kids Are Hungry And Impatient</h2>
<p>First, find the recipe.</p>
<p>If it has no story attached, gather the ingredients and follow it.</p>
<p>But if it has a story attached:</p>
<p>Let your eyes wander across the words of the story, as quickly as is necessary, until you find the part where the story ends and the recipe begins.</p>
<p>Mark that place in pencil so you can find it more quickly the next time you make this recipe.</p>
<p>Set yourself a reminder to read the story while you wait for the water to boil, or for the onions to caramelize, or for the oven to warm up.</p>
<p>Whisper thanks to the person who wrote the story, for sharing a part of themselves with you while also helping you feed your family.</p>
<p>Now follow the recipe, and make dinner.</p>

        
            <h1>Gift Of The Greywood</h1>
            <p>The wolves guard their secrets heavily, chased as they are by selfish glory-hunters, but with persistence and the slightest bit of luck, the right scrap of paper passes into the right Weaver’s hands. From pack to pack comes the following, simply beginning with <strong>“for those who need it”</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>First, the tough love: yeah, it’s always gonna hurt. Bones shifting and cracking, muscles stretching and snapping tend to be painful. Luckily, the first time is always the worst time, so it’s at least uphill from here. That said, we got our ways.</p>
<p>Stretching, that’s rule number one. Massages too. A body that can move as best as it can is always gonna be better prepared for the shift. But let’s be honest, bodies suck at staying perfect for long. So, let’s assume you need something more.</p>
<p>The greywood comes into play here. Our pack’s namesake, your namesake, has its secrets, and with those come answers. Find the trees with the bark the colour of steel, they’ll usually be marked. Strip the outside, the soft bits inside the chippings are ingredient one. Ingredient two? The roots of the purple flowers that grow near the ferns with the red leaves.</p>
<p>Boil the roots and the soft bark into a stew, and take a grey’s advice here: add some of the sap of the tree and mint cause otherwise this is gonna come up the way you try to take it down. Strain and continue to boil until it’s a syrup the colour of gold.</p>
<p>Two drops, every morning. I like it in oatmeal. And remember pup, a lone wolf has no one to hug away the pain. Actually, make that rule number one.</p>
</blockquote>

        
            <h1>The Last Ritual</h1>
            <p>For the times where the memories are too painful to bear, when sorrow plagues your waking hours and the burden is too heavy to carry. This is the last ritual before your new remembering, and hopefully, the last of Last Rituals.</p>
<p><strong>This is how we put to sleep the pain that hampers your spirit.</strong></p>
<p>First, you gather the things of your past.</p>
<p>The ones that remind you too much of what has long gone.</p>
<p>The ones that haunt you of the things you should’ve have done,</p>
<p>Or failed to do.</p>
<p>Gather them, and feel their weight in your hands for one last time.</p>
<p>Feel the sorrow that premates from them, but do not linger.</p>
<p>For this is the last time you will feel it.</p>
<p>Recount how much you have grown since then,</p>
<p>How much joy you have brought to the people around you.</p>
<p>Then, one by one, let them be consumed by cleansing flames.</p>
<p>Watch them turn into ash and smoke,</p>
<p>Scattered into the wind.</p>
<p>Tell the dust that settles:</p>
<pre><code>You no longer have power over me.
Nor will I continue letting you cause me pain.
I have learned and grown so much.
And I will keep doing so without you.
It is time to move on.
It is time to for a new remembering,
Ones better than the last.</code></pre>

        
            <h1>The Skipping Stones</h1>
            <p><em>Do you wish to know of the gift that comes from a shooting star?</em></p>
<p>Up above is a blanket black with a stream of stars, that wraps around and stretches endless. Often here there’s comfort sought, within their gleam and glow. It’s warmth, soft hope in twinkling light.</p>
<p>But wait – see change, see burst, see bright.</p>
<p>A streak of silver and speck of space, it burns and forges a path. It plummets with a driving force towards the earth. To seek, to settle, to claim a home.</p>
<p>Follow its dive, and chase the tail it leaves to find it  in its hidden place.</p>
<p>A fractured stone; the fallen star stands tall within the centre of a brilliant lake. Tide reaches forth, and with its push and pull, its gentle tumble, the water draws you near.</p>
<p>Here you stand on the shore; vast and bright. The water stills. Look into its depths and see the stars submerged, see illumination speckled. A reflection. A mirror of what was once above. You stand in-between, in this space betwixt sky and earth. This place of eternal night.</p>
<p>The glow of silver spots beneath the water, a stark contrast with shore’s blackened stone. These are old wishes, old dreams, old stories of those that came before.</p>
<p>To add your treasure, add your tale, take stone from shore and paint with ink. Draw swirls, make lines, add colour, and here is where the magic starts. A wish is made within the pigmentation, a bond embedded into stone made warm. Your soul and spark. Just a piece. A little part.</p>
<p>Your very own small shooting star.</p>
<p>Take a breath. Release. Cast stone and let it fly. Cause disturbance in once stillness. Break tension, see water wake and how the ripples grow. See a bead of light grow bright with every splash from stone.</p>
<p>Kinetics. A transfer and exchange with the movement made.</p>
<p>But, will the wish set sail and head towards its home? Or will it fall, set anchor and be stone once more? Still, submerged  and nestled in the deep and black? Forgotten, perhaps. See here! What’s often motionless and sturdy skips, it flies and flits ahead. A wave then comes, follows - gives chase and causes shift as speckled silver scatters. Spark once more, and laws of motion held. External force meets rest and friction leads to light.</p>
<p>See change, see burst, see bright.</p>
<p>A streak of silver and speck of space, it burns and forges a path. Follow its rise, and chase the tail it leaves to find a wish is granted.</p>
<p>See the stars below, now stars above. And now may you take your leave. A gift - something known, something to share: the story of the skipping stones.</p>

        
            <h1>Haunted By A Flame</h1>
            <p>It began as it always does, with a death. And in the void of the dearly departed, something came to rest. It doesn’t matter how, it doesn’t matter who, the story does not remember.</p>
<p>Faces in fireplaces, ghosts in iron grates, memory cracked forth from coal and ash. Not as simple as malevolence, nor as complex as cruelty. As for how, and who, the story cannot remember.</p>
<p>Voices howled through winds, reaching out with promise. Magic, mystery, music, inspiration. It yearned to be heard, acknowledged, loved. These stories will not remember.</p>
<p>Our stories are written by us, so instead we call them nuisance. We bar doors and shutter windows, we hide from what we don’t know. We react with fear.</p>
<p>But they are just as us. Reaching out, as we cry terror. Some doors should not be barred. Some fears should not be cowed to.</p>
<p>That home was theirs too. But our stories refuse to remember.</p>

        
            <h1>A Forest of Fragments</h1>
            <p>Rhythm seizes senses first, a thrum that prickles skin</p>
<p>And there ahead, within a camp a figure known as kin.</p>
<p>With birdsong voice, they call and pull, they tempt you to draw near</p>
<p>So come in close and share a fire, for what is there to fear?</p>
<p>What follows is their music soft, a gentle pleasing tune</p>
<p>It guides, it leads, it offers place, beneath the gleaming moon</p>
<p>So sit, so listen, so seek songs sweet and settle by the warmth and heat -</p>
<p><strong>But wait.</strong></p>
<p>A chord is struck, with finger’s flex and story starts to spill</p>
<p>Your racing heart, the snare of breath and suddenly there’s chill</p>
<p>See now the shine of silver thread, and a jagged-tooth type smile</p>
<p>Dread swallowed, not honey sweet - you’re trapped by musician’s guile</p>
<p><strong>They begin to sing.</strong></p>
<p><em>Take heed for where your feet do tread, for a dreamer’s silk may stray.</em></p>
<p><em>It  touches skin, and there you are, in a forest among the fey.</em></p>
<p><em>And gentle though these strings may be, the tune it plays does strike a fee.</em></p>
<p><em>A song of comfort and promised sleep, but when you wake your dreams they keep.</em></p>
<p><em>But worry not, for all’s not lost. It’s there among the morning frost.</em></p>
<p><em>Light pierces a green canopy, a forest’ made of pine.</em></p>
<p><em>And there it is, a glimmer, coloured glass with fragments sharp that shine.</em></p>
<p><em>They hold within a memory - something to recall.</em></p>
<p><em>Though beware. Where there is light there’s also shadow, a nightmare and a fall.</em></p>
<p><em>Weigh risk upon a set of scales for danger lurks in a selfish clutch</em></p>
<p><em>And darkness over all prevails, if hands are cut from a single touch.</em></p>
<p><em>A fog will settle where once was clear, and in  the darkness, shades appear.</em></p>
<p><em>They’ll lurk in sleepers’ corner’s sight, shambling figures from the dead of night.</em></p>
<p><em>For what is held is theirs to own, a trade for pleasant dreams they’ve shown.</em></p>
<p><em>A theft will lead to trickery, bonds broken - you’ll hear the shatter.</em></p>
<p><em>Try to escape, to run, and hide - for nought, it will not matter.</em></p>
<p><em>Ahead of you, your frantic gaze, the forest grows into a maze,</em></p>
<p><em>and there you’ll be among <strong>Unfound</strong> in spirits’ realm now stuck and bound.</em></p>
<p><em>So still your hands and walk instead</em></p>
<p><em>Show respect, and just ahead</em></p>
<p><em>Trees curl to form an arch and door, pass through - wake safe on the forest’s floor.</em></p>
<p><em>Untouched, unhurt, whole, and sound. Your head rests softly on the ground.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Are you tired?</em> They ask. <em>Then rest.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Let sleep settle in your bones.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Listen,</em> they say. <em>Take comfort.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Follow rhythm, music, tones.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>But remember my warning - of the forest and the fey.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>There is a path, you must not stray.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Goodnight, sleep tight.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Good luck.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>May morning come with gentle light.</em></strong></p>

        
            <h1>The First Ritual</h1>
            <p>Here it is, the first ritual that was ever created, the one that started the practice of weaving. Or maybe it wasn’t the first. But it’s the first one we know of that was written down.</p>
<p>We don’t know who wrote it.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>This is how we say good-bye, to those we will never see again.</strong></p>
<p>First, you must wipe the tears from your face.</p>
<p>The tears that tell you the longing is coming.</p>
<p>The tears that know your heart before your mind does.</p>
<p>The tears that well up, that turn your face hot, that trap you in.</p>
<p>These tears.</p>
<p>First, wipe them away.</p>
<p>Thank them for reminding you of the place in your life that is now empty.</p>
<p>Turn your eyes, if you can, to the leaving, or the departed.</p>
<p>Tell them, so they can hear you:</p>
<pre><code>I will miss you
I will always wish we had more time
I will cherish your memory and keep it safe in the tapestry of my life
I will weave new memories to cover the hole in my heart but I will never fill it in
I will miss you
I—will—miss—you.
</code></pre>
<p><strong>This is how we say good-bye.</strong></p>

        
            <h1>Appendix</h1>
            <p>A ritual is an action, or a pattern of actions, that carry meaning and purpose. A handshake can be a ritual. A recipe can be a ritual. A song can be a ritual.</p>
<p>The act of writing can be a ritual too. When you set your writing tools to work with meaning and purpose, you are engaging in a ritual action.</p>
<p>The rituals in this appendix might not all look like steps to follow. Sometimes the ritual is the reading of it. Take your time with these. Read them with care.</p>

        
            <h1>Woe Woodworks Mementos</h1>
            <p>The Woe Woodworks Company specializes in wooden goods - household items, toys, furniture. They may even be commissioned for larger pieces, like vehicle parts, sculptures, and engraved fixtures.</p>
<p>Every single item is produced from trees grown in the Woods of Woe, where local lore is that if you wish to rid yourself of a sorrowful memory, you whisper it to a sapling and plant it in the grove. As the tree grows, your memories disappear, taken in by the tree. The trees grow far too tall, and far too quickly, but for the industrial minds of Woe Woodworks, this means that there is never a lack of lumber. But as the wooden goods spread across the realms, they bring their whispers with them.</p>
<h2 id="memories-in-the-wood-grain" tabindex="-1">Memories in the wood grain</h2>
<p>People of all sorts visit the Woods of Woe to leave their whispers to the trees, later to be harvested and transformed into various items. No two whispers are alike, as no two experiences of pain are alike.</p>
<ul>
<li>A lover’s farewell caught in the teeth of a wooden comb. The longer you brush your hair, the more you wish never to let go.</li>
<li>A child’s laugh bubbles in a varnished cup. You don’t know why the faint laughter makes you want to weep.</li>
<li>A drunkard’s secret lines a carved cup. Anything you drink from it tastes the way hope does when it sours.</li>
<li>A soldier’s song is heard when you enter through a chiseled door frame. It makes you feel that once you leave, you will never return.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 id="the-echo-of-old-whispers" tabindex="-1">The echo of old whispers</h3>
<p>The Woe Woodworks Company has produced countless items over the years. They may be kept, sold, inherited, stolen, buried, enshrined, or forgotten.</p>
<p>Some whispers are powerful, evoking immediate and visceral reactions to even a cursory interaction with the item.</p>
<p>Others are more subtle, with their influence felt only in dreams, or very slowly, over continuous exposure over the years.</p>
<p>Each item contains a memory that may:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compel you to do something - to sing at the window of a dying man,  to create a masterpiece that will last, to seek revenge for a wrong done, or to solve a mystery regardless of whether it was solved years ago.</li>
<li>Inspire strong emotions, like rage, despair, or terror, although you may not understand why.</li>
<li>Invite contemplation of a life that is not yours, that you may learn something from it.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="woe-woodworks-company-exception-clause" tabindex="-1">Woe Woodworks Company exception clause</h3>
<p>By purchasing any item created and sold by the Woe Woodworks Company, the buyer agrees that the company will not be held liable for any inconvenience, misfortune, pervasive melancholy, horror, or bouts of violence to arise from contact or usage of aforementioned item/s, and to waive seeking damages in the form of monetary or corporal compensation. This is transferred to any and all owners or users of the item in perpetuity.</p>
