                <h1>Basics of Play</h1>
                <p>For both <em>Into the Grey</em> and <em>Deck Burner</em>, the cycle of play in Mnemonic follows a set pattern: Each player takes the lead in describing their character’s actions through a scene where their character has focus; then, once everyone has had a turn to lead, the group comes together to address the complications that may have arisen during each player’s individual scenes.</p>
<p>You can also use this framework to come up with new modes of play.</p>
<h2 id="individual-scenes" tabindex="-1">Individual Scenes</h2>
<p>Individual Scenes are ones in which a player’s character is doing something related to their particular needs and skill set. Your character might not be the only person <em>present</em> in the scene (and in fact I encourage you to invite other players into your scene to help you tell your character’s story), but in terms of action and mechanics, the Individual Scene is about one character: yours.</p>
<p>To play out the scene, follow this process, adding narrative details wherever and however you find them appropriate.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Choose a card from your hand or draw one from the deck. The face or number on the card tells you a bit of interpretive information about who’s in the scene with you or what the scene is about. Maybe the card just gives you a prop to play with; think of it as a story prompt, which you can follow as closely or loosely as you like.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3 id="card-prompts" tabindex="-1">Card Prompts</h3>
<p>When you play a card, either from your hand or from the top of the deck, begin by consulting the following table. You don’t <em>have</em> to do this step, but it may help for framing your scene.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th style="text-align:left">Card</th>

</li>
<li>
<p>Choose a skill for your character that matches the suit of the card you played.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3 id="asking-for-help" tabindex="-1">Asking for Help</h3>
<p>If you don’t have any skills that match the suit, you can ask another player to join you in the scene to assist you; then choose whatever skill you like. Have them choose a skill for their character to use. They won’t be rolling, but you’ll need to know what skill they used in the event of an <strong>injury</strong>; a player that assists you also assumes the same risks as you during the scene.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gather and roll a number of dice equal to the rating for the skill you chose. Keep the highest result.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the highest result is anything other than a 6, your actions result in a <strong>Complication</strong>, which is added to the Adversary’s pool for the next Group Scene.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(Optional) Perform a <strong>weaving</strong> to remove a Complication from the Adversary’s pool, or to give one other player an extra die in their next roll.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3 id="weaving" tabindex="-1">Weaving</h3>
<p>To perform a weaving, ask another player to choose an option from the Weaver’s Dice, and then roll a single die, and interpret the results:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>1 (Bend):</strong> The world barely moves to aid you, leaving you to overexert yourself in your efforts. <strong>Mark an injury.</strong></li>
<li><strong>2–3 (Weave):</strong> The world moves to your aid, meeting your need as readily as a friend.</li>
<li><strong>4–5 (Fray):</strong> The world leaps to your aid, with such force that you can barely contain its power.</li>
<li><strong>6 (Tear):</strong> The world overwhelms you, running amok with the full force of its power. <strong>Mark an injury.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>If another player is assisting you in this scene, they must mark an injury if you do.</p>
<h4 id="marking-injuries" tabindex="-1">Marking Injuries</h4>
<p>When you mark an <strong>injury</strong>, make a note of it next to the skill you used in that scene. Whenever you use a skill that has been marked with injuries, you roll <em>one fewer dice</em> for each injury marked. If this would mean you roll no dice, you <em>cannot use that skill.</em></p>
<p>Injuries are removed when the group <strong>spends time in recovery</strong>.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Pass the focus of play to the next player, and lend them your attention as best you can.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once everyone has played out a scene, choose:</p>
<ul>
<li>End the game here</li>
<li>Play a <strong>Group Scene</strong></li>
<li>Play another round of Individual Scenes</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="group-scenes" tabindex="-1">Group Scenes</h2>
<p>In a Group Scene, everyone must work together to deal with the consequences of their actions. You cannot have a Group Scene without first laying the groundwork for everyone’s characters in Individual Scenes first. (Well, you could, but the stakes would be floppy and impersonal, and more practically the Adversary’s pool would be utterly empty of Complications).</p>
<p>To play a Group Scene:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Set the Stakes:</strong> Gather the Adversary’s dice - one for each Complication that has been accumulated thusfar.</li>
<li><strong>Make the Plan:</strong> Have each player choose a skill. For <em>Deck Burner</em>, first have everyone draw a card from the top of the deck; the skill they choose must match the suit of the card they draw.</li>
<li><strong>Execute the Plan:</strong> Have every player roll their dice separately, keeping their highest roll.</li>
<li><strong>Things Go Wrong:</strong> Roll the Adversary’s dice, keeping all of them.</li>
<li><strong>Sort it Out:</strong> Starting with the lowest roll, have each player describe their actions in the scene. If a Complication die interrupts the order, describe how things go wrong. When you get to the highest roll, determine:
<ul>
<li><strong>Victory:</strong> The players overcome the scene’s obstacles and resolve the scene on their own terms. The player with the highest roll describes how their action brings the scene to a close. Either end the game here, or play a new round of Individual Scenes.</li>
<li><strong>Defeat:</strong> The players are overwhelmed by the consequences of their actions, and are forced to live with them, at least for now. Every player <strong>marks an injury</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>After Defeat:</strong> Empty the Adversary’s pool of Complications; then, for each of the Adversary’s dice that rolled higher than <em>all</em> of the players’, add a Complication back to the pool. Then choose:
<ul>
<li><strong>Try Again:</strong> Play out another Group Scene, starting with <strong>Set the Stakes</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Regroup:</strong> Play a new round of Individual Scenes.</li>
<li><strong>Retreat:</strong> End the game here.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
