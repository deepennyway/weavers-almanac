    <h1>Rynwood, the Forest of Silk</h1>
    
    
        
            <h2 class="author">written by Dee, the Weaver in Green</h2>
        
        

<p>Seen from afar, the forest known as Rynwood looks like any other stand of old-growth trees, with vibrant green canopies and thick brown trunks. Coming closer, a traveler starts to see movement among the branches, imperceptible shifts of the foliage and the bark. Come close enough, and you’ll see the vast network of silk threads that give the Forest of Silk its name.</p>
<p>The trees of Rynwood have hollow trunks, growing their heartwood to accommodate a thriving community of spiders. The trees provide safe shelter for the silk-weavers when the rains and winds come, and in return the spiders protect the trees from insects, strangling vines, and predatory logging companies.</p>
<p>Spiderfolk live here too: human-looking people who share some of the spiders’ most well-known traits. Some spiderfolk look more like human-sized spiders, but spiderfolk come in all shapes and sizes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When telling a story that includes the Silk Grove, consider the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>How do the spiders know what the trees need, and vice versa?</li>
<li>How do visitors to the grove know to be careful with the space?</li>
<li>What is your relationship to the tree that gives you shelter?</li>
<li>What does Silk Grove teach you about the ways your home provides you shelter—and how do you maintain the safety of your home in return?</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="story-arc%3A-the-elder-tree" tabindex="-1">Story Arc: The Elder Tree</h2>
<p>Most of the trees in Rynwood are older than some cities, but at the heart of the Forest of Silk is the Elder Tree, a massive giant that provides nutrients to the whole forest. In this story, we will visit the Elder Tree, and discover a sickness that threatens all of Rynwood.</p>
<h3 id="the-first-gathering" tabindex="-1">The First Gathering</h3>
<p>When we first meet, we are on our way to Rynwood. Some of us might just be passing through on the way to somewhere else; others have business in the Forest of Silk. All of us know someone who lives in the forest, who has told us how to be careful if we haven’t been here before. The spiders are nervous, but not about us; something is happening to Rynwood, and no one is talking about it.</p>
<h3 id="into-the-grey" tabindex="-1">Into the Grey</h3>
<p>Our exploration of the forest city illuminates more of the struggles facing the people who live here: trees beginning to rot, leaves drying out despite plenty of rain. Eventually we find the Elder Tree, once a bright tower ripe with fruit and phosphorescent moss, now a grey shadow of its former self. We must find the source of the Elder Tree’s distress, and fast; the whole of Rynwood depends on its support.</p>
<h3 id="deck-burner" tabindex="-1">Deck Burner</h3>
<p>We find the source of the Elder Tree’s sickness: a rampant invasive fungus that was carried here by a visiting lumber tycoon who has it in their head that the infection will make the trees more valuable for logging. We must deal with the fungus, and then find the tycoon and put a stop to their pursuits.</p>
<h3 id="laid-to-rest" tabindex="-1">Laid to Rest</h3>
<p>Whether we stop the infection or not, the fungus has taken its toll on Rynwood and the people who live there. We find a moment to reflect on what was lost, and grieve for what cannot be replaced.</p>
