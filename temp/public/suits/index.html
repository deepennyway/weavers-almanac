                <h1>~ Sample Character Concepts</h1>
                <p>If you’d rather just pick something from a list, here are sixteen excellent character concepts that are all worth playing, and even come with some helpful roleplaying hooks to get you engaging with other players. If this is your first time playing a game like this where you’re telling a story with other people, I recommend picking one of these concepts to start.</p>
<p>In the interest of transparency, here’s how the concepts came together:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Aces</strong> are solitary characters, preferring their own company over the company of others.</li>
<li><strong>Jacks</strong> are troublemakers, acting on a continuous impulse to show the world its unseen potential.</li>
<li><strong>Queens</strong> are characters focused on the community they inhabit, looking for ways to bring people together.</li>
<li><strong>Kings</strong> are characters striving for systems of order, serving as reminders of the responsibilities everyone must share to take care of the world they live in.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can use those summaries as a first step to finding the concept you want, or you can start by looking at the suit that fits your needs best and go from there.</p>
<h2 id="spades" tabindex="-1">Spades</h2>
<p>Tools of the trade, weapons of war, these are the things that you craft or own or have personal relationship to that are outside of yourself, which are so much a part of you that they are an <em>extension</em> of yourself.</p>
<p>If Spades is your jam, you might dig these concepts:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Fighter (Jack of Spades)</strong> - When you’re cornered, everything you own becomes a deadly weapon.</li>
<li><strong>The Mercenary (Ace of Spades)</strong> - You’re here to do a job, not make friends. You follow your own rules.</li>
<li><strong>The Engineer (Queen of Spades)</strong> - Every part of the has its purpose, and its own needs as well. If you don’t maintain your tools, they’ll quickly crumble into dust.</li>
<li><strong>The Soldier (King of Spades)</strong> - You follow orders, and insist that others do the same. Best not to question it.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="clubs" tabindex="-1">Clubs</h2>
<p>Relationships with people and the world around you. You might have skills that address specific kinds of social interaction like Ordering Takeout, or you might have had to develop skills for dealing with specific people, like Officer Spangleburst.</p>
<p>If that sounds like you, try out these concepts:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Lover (Jack of Clubs)</strong> - You make friends with everybody, and everybody loves you in return. How can you possibly choose a best friend from all these lovely people?</li>
<li><strong>The Loner (Ace of Clubs)</strong> - Your friends are the wind, the tracks that lead you to your next dinner. Other people only get in the way.</li>
<li><strong>The Mother (Queen of Clubs)</strong> - Your favorite part of the day is bringing a smile to someone’s face when they’re having a rough time, helping them get back on their feet to try again when they fall down.</li>
<li><strong>The Gardener (King of Clubs)</strong> - You know what the world needs, and how to provide it. You can grow a full harvest from a handful of seeds, a forest from a single cutting.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="diamonds" tabindex="-1">Diamonds</h2>
<p>Talents of the mind, or wisdom gleaned from study or experience. You might be very good at Puzzles, or maybe you just Know About Reptiles.</p>
<p>If mental acuity is the thing you want to focus on, these might be good concepts for you:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Gambler (Jack of Diamonds)</strong> - You always know the odds, and sometimes the best days are when you beat them.</li>
<li><strong>The Construct (Ace of Diamonds)</strong> - You see yourself for what you are: a constructed individual made up of component parts that could be disassembled at any time. The world doesn’t fully understand you. Maybe it’s better that way.</li>
<li><strong>The Teacher (Queen of Diamonds)</strong> - People remember the lessons you give them. You might not know <em>everything</em>, but you know enough to help people find their way.</li>
<li><strong>The Architect (King of Diamonds)</strong> - You have a plan for that.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="hearts" tabindex="-1">Hearts</h2>
<p>Your body is your home, your vessel, your shelter. Take care of it, and it will take care of you. Maybe you can Climb really well. Maybe your Yearning is so strong it’s physical.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Dancer (Jack of Hearts)</strong> - You don’t so much walk around the ground as bounce off of it between aerials.</li>
<li><strong>The Immortal (Ace of Hearts)</strong> - You can’t die. Really. It’s uncanny.</li>
<li><strong>The Shield (Queen of Hearts)</strong> - If there’s danger, you’re ready to take the brunt of it in order to let others find safety.</li>
<li><strong>The Muscle (King of Hearts)</strong> - You can lift that car no problem; the challenge is not lifting it <em>too</em> good.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="ace-of-clubs%3A-the-loner" tabindex="-1">Ace of Clubs: The Loner</h3>
<p>The loner would always rather work alone, but for some reason keeps getting sucked into protecting these other people who don’t know what they’re doing. The loner does not make friends, they do not hug, they <em>definitely</em> do not trust people. The loner has developed a set of rules for survival that they can name at a moment’s notice, and they are all oddly specific.</p>
<p>The loner is always right about the things they have experience with. Somehow they have experience with everything.</p>
<p>The loner doesn’t like you. They don’t know why they still stick with you. They swear, they’re just helping you today. Tomorrow they’ll be gone. Really. This time they mean it.</p>
<p>Maybe the day after tomorrow. You certainly don’t need them. It’s them who’d be useless without you.</p>

<p><strong>Roleplaying Hook: <em>You Need Me (I Need You)</em></strong></p>
<p>When you meet someone new, sort them into one of three categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>They’re an enemy; I’d better keep an eye on them.</li>
<li>They want something; I’d better not let these other fools get tricked into giving away everything they own.</li>
<li>They’re definitely going to die without my help; I’d better make sure they don’t fall into a hole or something.</li>
</ul>
<p>Deep down, it’s probably because you actually <em>do</em> like them and want to spend time with them. But it’s better not to let them know that.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="ace-of-spades%3A-the-mercenary" tabindex="-1">Ace of Spades: The Mercenary</h3>
<p>All you know is violence. Your only friends are the tools of violence. They’re the only friends you need.</p>
<p>People ask you how you sleep at night. You don’t. Why would you need to? Sleep is for those who have dreams. All your dreams are violence.</p>
<p>Your violence might not be physical. Your tools might not have blades or cannons. But your path is one of destruction, and if you stay on it too long, you’ll inevitably destroy yourself as well.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Roleplaying Hook: <em>The Measuring Stick</em></strong></p>
<p>When you meet someone new, size them up:</p>
<ul>
<li>If they’re stronger than you, you must somehow prove your worth to them. You’re not sure why.</li>
<li>If they’re weaker than you, you must protect them at all costs, whether they want you to or not.</li>
<li>If you don’t know how strong they are, you must find a way to test their strength against yours.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="ace-of-diamonds%3A-the-construct" tabindex="-1">Ace of Diamonds: The Construct</h3>
<p>Some people become; others are made. Maybe you weren’t literally built from pieces of metal or other materials, maybe you were just subjected to severe conditioning that stripped you of your humanity. Maybe you’ve just always had an awareness that we construct ourselves and the world constructs us, constantly. (Maybe everyone is constructed in this way, you’re just the only one who knows it.)</p>
<p>Whatever your method of construction, you’ve never felt at home in the community you’re in; there are rules and conditions of social behavior that to you seem either too obscure to understand.</p>
<p>That’s not to say you <em>never</em> know what rules are supposed to follow. But some rules are just too petty to bother following, much less learning in the first place.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Watch Out For Casual Ableism!</strong></p>
<p>If you are physically constructed, like a robot or cybernetic person, remember that you are still alive as long as you have agency. You might think in terms of programs and functions, or you might think in more abstract ways, but what makes you a Construct is the way you perceive yourself and your relationship to the world, not the way others perceive you.</p>
<p>On a related note, if your constuctionism comes from neurodivergence (ADHD, Autism, Schizophrenia, Bipolar Disorder, etc.), avoid behavioral stereotypes that are outside your experience. A lot of the ways neurodivergence is portrayed in popular media are, at best, a limited slice of people’s actual lives, and at worst can reinforce stigmas that lead to real harm.</p>

</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Roleplaying Hook: <em>Same Hat?</em></strong></p>
<p>When you meet someone new, you notice something about them that reminds you of yourself, or of someone you once knew. You might not comment on it, but it’s enough to know that in some small way, you’re the same.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="ace-of-hearts%3A-the-immortal" tabindex="-1">Ace of Hearts: The Immortal</h3>
<p>Whether it’s a known fact of your existence that you cannot die, or just that you have unaccountably good luck when it comes to avoiding deadly scrapes, you cannot die, and this has given you a unique perspective on the ways of the world.</p>
<p>Pit full of acid? An inconvenience. Local baron sending soldiers into your town? A temporary frustration at most. You’ve seen how the world turns, and it always eventually turns again. It might have left you jaded, or cynical. But maybe it’s just that you know how things are, and that there’s no point fighting them. Just wait fifteen years; the weather will change on its own.</p>
<p>Even if it sometimes changes for the worse.</p>
<p>Maybe you really can’t die. Who did that to you? Did you do it to yourself? How long have you been walking this ball of dust? How many empires have you watched fall? When did you stop participating in history? When did you start avoiding its wake? How many lives have you lived, before you stopped caring about the world you’re stuck in?</p>
<p>Then again, maybe it’s more interesting if you’re not an inusfferably aloof asshole. A thousand years of perspective might make you care more, not less, because you see the ripples of actions people take—and the devastating inertia of actions people don’t.</p>

</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Roleplaying Hook: <em>An Unspoken Debt</em></strong></p>
<p>When you meet someone new, roll a d6. On a 1, you did something in the past that contributed directly to the hardships they face today. They might know it was you, or they might not. Either way, you know what you did, and it’s up to you to make it up to them.</p>
